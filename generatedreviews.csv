1365,after sinking the 2005 version of this wine for being discombobulated this seems like a total turnaround its dense and jammy like the previous year with similar toasted qualities but its also better balanced and mentally challenging with flavors of black olive baked berry fruit and earth finishes rich and oily with a distinct coffee flavor drink now into 2010

3411,good and wellstructured but sweet with cherry blackberry chocolate and anise flavors that taste like they were baked into a pastry

3779,heres one for the cellar the deliciousness factor is high but right now its all about intense primary flavors of red plums rasberries and mulberries framed within bold oak and tannins in part due to partial wholecluster fermentation still quite immature it needs at least six more years to meld but eventually its sure to be fantastic

3785,high acidity combines with ripe fruit to produce a tense fullbodied wine at this stage the fruit has not yet integrated with the tannins
3786,high in acidity and bone dry this lightcolored pinot seems a bit onedimensional right now but i think it was released too early it should gain momentum by the end of 2007 when the cherry rhubarb and cola flavors become more integrated with the tannins and oak if you have to drink it now decant for several hours
3787,high in acidity and ripe in pineapple and vanilla flavors this is a simple wine it has sweet and sour flavors like a sour cough drop

3800,hints at underripe peach on the nose then follows up with flavors of peach pineapple and a hint of white chocolate its medium in body with a relatively compact but clean finish

3804,hints of smoke and butter accent honey pear and apples on the nose while toastier grainy notes take the lead on the palate nicely textured in the mouth adding hints of vanilla on the finish probably fading a bit drink up

3814,hogues lowcost red is a roughly 5050 blend with surprising ripeness and sweetness for a wine in this price range theres just a bit of the bell pepper quality of inexpensive washington cabernet but not enough to be offputting the wine is reasonably ripe full and wellbalanced with fruit acids and tannins in equal proportion
3815,hogues reserve cabernet is tight and nicely structured with aromas of black fruits barrel toast and tar its tough and chewy herbal and tight and should be decanted so it can stretch out a bit before being drunk with the extra airtime youll get more black cherry currant and smoke and the green tannins subside
3816,holiday spice aromas are interesting enough although heavy cream and brown stemmy notes are a bit odd takes a turn for the better with flavors of dark berry cherry and allspice sour cherries mark the finish

3824,hot and baked with stewed blackberry flavors and a harsh finish
3825,hot and medicinal with baked flavors of berries
3826,hot and scoury in texture with a high alcohol burn in the finish but the blackberry blueberry mocha pepper and cedar flavors are pleasant
3827,hot and unbalanced in fruit with flavors that span the gamut from raisins to mint this zin is bone dry its a rustic wine with some rugged tannins and a coarse finish
3828,hot earthy aromas settle on leather and tomato while the palate is gritty and tastes of dark smoky chunky black fruit more tangy and angular on the finish than desirable with limited depth standard stuff on its best day
3829,how astonishing to find an oregon pinot noir just under 13 alcohol that is fully ripe and fragrant with a perfect balance of fruit herb and mineral the young raspberry fruit flavors and overall lightness of this wine match beautifully with lox or smoked salmon despite its elegance this strikes me as a wine that could turn out to be quite longlived given its impeccable balance
3830,how big this wine is but how drinkable now its not just the fruit which ranges from blackberries to cherries and cocoa its the tannic structure somehow its soft and intense at once totally dry and not overly alcoholic this zin picks up even more power on the finish
3831,huge wine young and tannic almost bitter now and not offering much relief but of course you dont buy beringer pr tonight there is indeed enormous cabernet flavor deep down inside offering oodles of blackberries and cherries and charry new oak but theres also a warning note of prune best after 2008
3832,hugely intense in fruity concentration few wines in the world have this size this ripeness this dramatic volume new oak is in keeping with the proportion of fruit and the tannins are strong and hard as they tend to be from this vineyard whichsprawls across atlas peak there seems to be no reason why this cabernet should not develop over the years hold until 2013 at the very least
3833,hugely perfumed pure syrah and flavors of blackcurrants and smoky wood this is a powerpacked wine which shows a great purity of fruit it has solid dark tannins as well which suggest it should age well over 510 years
3834,hunters is an old new zealand wine brand that should do better that said this is a solid savvie combining tropical fruit with fresh herbaceousness a suggestion of sweetness on the midpalate is balanced by tart acids on the finish
3835,husch was a pioneer of gewürztraminer in anderson valley and after all these years they still produce one of the more dependable bottlings in california its a clean dry spicy wine at a good price great to pair with todays ethnicinspired fare from indian to vietnamese
3836,hushed aromas of dark berry and a touch of cedar lead the nose on this blend of cabernet sauvignon and merlot the simple palate offers black cherry and a hint of white pepper alongside delicate fleeting tannins
3837,i had this wine in the early evening with a group of my closest girlfriends and it proved to be a real charmer its informal refreshing and recalls aromas of peach citrus raspberry and cranberry its not huge in intensity but has lively effervescence and good acidity
3838,i had to doublecheck the price on this brilliant wine because its much less than other napa cabs its a fat sweet fleshy wine instantly appealing for its delicious blackberry blackstrap molasses cherry violet and sweet oak flavors yet its a cellar guarantee the tannins are finely ground and wonderfully ripe giving the wine a firm lushness that lasts through a long satisfying finish should be easy to find with 10300 cases produced
3839,i have not been a great fan of this winerys bordeaux reds and this one also has a countrified thing going on despite some very ripe and lipsmacking cherry flavors half the oak barrels it was aged in were new
3840,i have watched this wine for some time and know that it is an ager especially in a great vintage like this one made from very high mayacamas mountain grapes its relentlessly tannic in its youth but the core of black cherry and cassis is fabulous hold until 2010
3841,i havent been a fan of the winerys pinot noirs and this release doesnt change my mind its simple and slightly sweettasting with baked cherry pie and coffee flavors and a heavy overlay of toast
3842,i like the dry balance with its wellcrafted tannins brisk acidity and gentle touch of oak but the taste is disappointingly thin showing herbdominated dill and tobacco with just a splash of cherry fruit
3843,i like the oak on this wine also the crispness the tropical fruit flavors but the creamy mouthfeel and the way the fruit is yielding to a sweet nutty character its just beginning a slow down and should remain interesting through 2007
3844,i like this merlot for its fullbodied richness and depth of flavor its so much better than the 02 with 15 cabernet its almost a full point higher in alcohol than the winerys bliss merlot and it shows in the opulent fat blackberry blueberry and cassis flavors
3845,i like this wine a lot for the great fruit its just jampacked with ripe cherries black raspberries sweet blackberries coffee and cocoa flavors that are rich in fruity essence yet dry soft and balanced this is a good value in a red table wine
3846,i love the briary spicy aroma on this wine its so inviting but then when you taste it it turns too soft and sweet like a melted cherry and cassisfilled chocolate truffle thats a delicious flavor but its not really a dry table wine
3847,i love this pinot for its dry silkiness fruit and the way its so complex and everchanging in the glass cherries raspberries cola plum skin mocha and dusty asian spice are the elementary flavors amplified by rich oak but its not a fruit bomb its elegant and complex exemplifying coolclimate california in a great vintage
3848,i love this pinot just love it its so soft and sensual so silky and velvety and so balanced and dry with a wealth of cola pomegranate persimmon cherry tea and spicy oak flavors its complex and delicious a wine that reveals layer after layer
3849,i papiri is a fresh and fragrant white with bright aromas of citrus cut grass and white peach pair it with any mediterranean fish dish
3850,i tasted this wine with kathy josephs fiddlestix bottling from her fiddlehead label and the wines are very different this seems less ripe harder in tannins and stronger in acids that is a stylistic choice of course but this wine is not as lush or immediately likeable although its still very good give it three to five years in the cellar
3851,i wanted to like this zin and while there are some good things there are problems the wine is very hot with a chile pepper heat that comes from extremely high alcohol that makes the underlying wild berry coffee and tobacco flavors hard to enjoy from mauritson although it doesnt say so on the front label
3852,if a blast of thick but classy oak doesnt bother you then this single vineyard wine comes highly recommended it gets better with every minute of air and along the way you get aromas of charcoal mint licorice and berries which are followed by flavors of blackberry prune cake and molasses this modern ripe eminently drinkable syrah weighs in at 145 alcohol
3853,if a chardonnay could suffer from something called barrel breath this one would its like a bowl full of lacquer and heady melon and the palate is sweet sweet sweet theres vanilla marshmallow and resin along with more typical melon and citrus a case of more being less just too much oak and candy to rate higher
3854,if at first sip this seems delicate thats an illusion reticent would be a better word for this is a wine that is still youthful with the toast and crisp acidity acting as a framework to the rich green and white fruits that are developing keep for 45 years
3855,if there is any complaint at all to be made about this wine its that it is too easy to drink succulent ripe honeyed fruit balanced by just enough acidity slips down without any edginess yet the flavors still linger nicely on the finish
3856,if there is one quality that distinguishes the wines of the late giuseppe quintarelli it is complexity unlike any other producer in the amarone production area this legendary artisan magically pulls out aromas of dried sage indian spice crushed white pepper and delicate forest berry on the palate the wine is bright crisp and intense but never heavy or syrupy italy lost one of its greatest winemakers when quintarelli passed away in early 2012
3857,if this is the reserve id hate to taste the regular theres almost no fruit with only a drop of citrus swimming in the alcohol and acidity
3858,if this wine had greater acidity for crispness it would be near perfect but as it stands its too soft too bad because the flavors of blackberries cassis chocolate anise mint and smoky vanilla are totally delicious the flabbiness is cause for concern
3859,if you are looking for a righton pure and typical example of washington syrah this is a good place to start the fruit is deep and black a mix of berries plums and cassis threaded with tobacco earth and iron ore everything seems softened and smoothed making this especially accessible in part most likely due to this supremely balanced vintage
3860,if you drink this wine too cold youll miss the nuances behind the pineapple orange and spice flavors theres a minerally undertow and some interesting herbal notes
3861,if you have a bottle of this in your cellar drink it now the wine still has some fruit flavors backed by roasted almond and spice but there are also barnyard or bandaid tones that seem to be taking over
3862,if you havent already tried pecorino colle dei venti is a good place to start this boasts loads of peach exotic fruit pineapple and pear with a medium body good structure and tartness
3863,if you know goldeneyes new gowen creek bottling this is a near identical pinot and little wonder for the vineyards are right next to each other this wine dazzles with exotic feral notes of wild blackberries and blueberries and forest scents of pine needle roasted mushroom grilled meat chocolate anise cinnamon nutmeg and coriander new oak adds even richer nuances of smoky caramel and vanilla to this compelling wine
3864,if you like em big and oaky then this ones for you aromas and flavors of woodgrilled peaches roasted red apples buttery toast and rich nuttiness all generously abound the mouth is full and slightly fat with moderate acidity and a mediumlength smoky finish
3865,if you like piña coladas and getting caught in theohi meancoladas and ripe banana caramel and pear aromas and flavors then this wine delivers theres an undeniable coconut quality here and nice acid zip that keeps the fruit in the mix the oak tannins need a bit of time to smooth outtheyre a little edgy on the back end
3866,if you like strong new zealandstyle gooseberry notes youll love this sauvignon blanc its ultradry potent in acidity and zesty clean but it does tread dangerously close to feline spray suggesting unripeness
3867,if you like the ripe extravagantly oaky style youll love this chardonnay it has opulent flavors of tropical fruit buttered toast caramel vanilla and honey which are brightened by acidity drink now
3868,if you like your chardonnay on the fruity side this ones for you its rich in pineapple orange and apricot jam flavors with notes of buttered toast and cream
3869,if you like your sauvignon blanc herbal then this is the wine for you its very fruity and new world in style has tight acidity and is ready to drink
3870,if you need convincing of the true potential of the la clape region of languedoc look no futher this is a delicate yet complex wine of true character and depth with a beautiful bouquet of rich dark fruit tea leaves leather and menthol the mouth smooth and lush is loaded with intense plum cherry spice and pepper the balance is fantastic making this an easy wine to enjoy now or an excellent candidate to hold for 35 years
3871,if you want a more earthy style of red burgundy this is the wine for you it has a definite funky edge lying against the ripe tannins and sweet soft jammy fruit the acidity comes through to finish a wine with weight and character

4016,its an intriguing idea to blend fruit from the rhine and the mosel theoretically balancing the best qualities of each astute tasters will catch a little bit of that in this wine with darker spice notes playing against brighter floral nuances the result is a pleasant if rather generic riesling that finishes with soft pear and melon fruit
4017,its aromas are quite niceclay black cherry eraser graham crackerbut the palate doesnt deliver the goods quite as prettily has a paperywooly feel fruit has a green sourish edge not imported to the us
4018,its been an uphill battle for pietra santa with this variety and the 05 doesnt help matters the wine is harsh in acids with modest cherry and herb flavors and an annoyingly astringent finish

4023,its fresh in vibrant acidity with grapy flavors of citrus and gooseberries theres a creamy lushness to the texture that softens and attracts
4024,its interesting and a little odd that this 100 sauvignon blanc from mondavis heralded to kalons great i block already is showing signs of maturity although its only about three years old the reserve to kalon released more than a year ago was fresh and fruity this wine by contrast is beginning to show mushroom herb and mineral complexities alongside the citrus fruits its a very fine wine superior in structural integrity and bone dry but it will separate wine lovers into opposing camps
4025,its light tart and spicy but nicely crafted with a pleasing elegance the cooler climate ups the citrus flavors sharpens the acids and actually enhances the white pepper of the syrah
4026,its nice that theyve held back this wine for a few years before releasing it because its beginning to meld together in a very delightful way the tannins oak and alcohol are coalescing with the cherries pomegranates cola tangerine vanilla and spices giving the wine a silky complex mellow mouthfeel beautifully dry and lush now and should develop through 2012
4027,its nice to see an everincreasing number of serviceable kosher wines like this one being made available to consumers from around the world that said this one isnt much more than adequate theres a modest amount of cassis fruit dressed up with earthy chocolate and vaguely minty aromas but it lacks depth still its better than the kosher stuff i remember from my friends bar mitzvahs

4307,like many of the perrin fils wines this one is firmly structured its cherry and cocoa flavors ending on a dusty tannic note but the fruit is attractive and even boasts some complexity in the wisps of garrigue on the nose probably best from 20132017

4320,like the regular 2003 bottling theres a slightly herbal or haylike note on the nose of this wine but also floral hints and bright cherry aromas lacks the depth and drama of the superb 2002 but still a nice wine finishes with some dry ng tannins so hold a couple of years before opening imported by sauvage selections
4321,like the winerys other 2005 chardonnays this one tasted in march is tightly wound and minerally the aroma will show little if the wine is too cold flavorwise hints of tart tangerines lemongrass green apples candied ginger and vanilla cream swirl into a smoky oak spicy finish this is a chardonnay that needs some time in the bottle drink now and for a couple of years

4764,nice and sweet in honeyed orange flavors with a hit of spice and acidity gives this dessert wine a crisp balance its not particularly intense or complex though
4765,nice cab a rutherfordst helena blend thats tannic enough to warrant time in the cellar too young to really show its stuff now but theres a chunk of flashy blackberry and cherry fruit and enough balancing acids to let it develop well through 2012
4766,nice color and plenty of fruit on the nose add up to a welcome mat the palate deals berry fruit galore especially raspberry cassis and black cherry juicy but still a little plump on the finish with overall balance equal to that of a dancer imported by frederick wildman sons ltd

4769,nice herbal notes unfold in the bouquet with notes of lime rind underripe peach and soft bell pepper coming through in the mouth the finish is clean like freshcut grass and the overall experience enjoyable
4770,nice licorice and black currant scents fill the bouquet with a touch of mentholy bramble adding some flair the palate is bright and fruit forward the dominating dark fruit flavors lifted by peppery spice medium weight with soft tannins and a solid finish
4771,nice now at 5plus years in the bottle with fully resolved tannins making the wine softly creamy in the mouth the fruit is beginning to fall out leaving a dry herbaceousness to the departing blackberries and cherries which are fusing with the sweet vanillins of oak shows real elegance of structure but its all downhill from here so drink up
4772,nice on the nose with berry aromas ample richness and rubber the powerful palate delivers bigtime blackberry toast roasted plum coffee and chocolate while the finish is also chocolaty and stout in structure chunky but tasty a good jumilla wine consisting of 85 monastrell and 15 syrah

4774,nice wine with standard rioja aromas of raspberry vanilla licorice and dill the palate has life and kick due to protruding acidity while the flavor profile is based on snappy hightoned plum and red berry softer on the finish where butter and vanilla notes rise up drinkable now but will hold for another few years
4775,nice yet quiet on the opening with lime apple and minerally aromas feels tangy maybe a touch sharp and pointed with standard casablanca flavors of lime bell pepper and green apple short and tangy on the finish with washing acidity
4776,nicely aromatic with all thats good about affordable malbec from argentina bold fruit depth and some richness the palate is plump and stocked with tasty blackberry plum and raisin flavors while the finish is sturdy and subtle a good wine that should not offend anyone

4778,nicely blends ripe peaches with wet stones to give a wine that has something for fruit and rocklovers alike its medium to fullbodied finishing with accents of dried spices drink now2010
4779,nicely built on a solid red fruit core the berry cherry and licorice aromas and flavors here wear a heavy wood cloak that holds the fruit in check a bit too much its hard not to feel that the full potential of the fruit has been stymied here still the mouthfeel is good and it finishes with attractive spicy dry cherry anise and wood notes will appeal more to lovers of lavish oak
4780,nicely complex on the nose offering up dusty minerally notes alongside baked apple flavors feature some petrol notes but also honey and preserved citrus ending a little short drink now
4781,nicely concentrated with layers of chocolate and potent cassis flavors that are tinged with hints of peppery spice mediumbodied with enough structure to make it capable of lasting several years in the cellar
4782,nicely done and balanced especially for chilean rosé comprised of heavier grape types like cabernet sauvignon and shiraz the bouquet shows some rubber and smoke at first and then it settles on clean berry fruit the palate is simple round and well sized with plum and apple skin flavors drink now while its fresh and lively
4783,nicely done at an affordable price this wine starts off a bit slow with tea and cranberry aromas leading the way but it deepens and darkens with air developing cherry plum and cola flavors and finishing with a hint of coffee imported by australian wine connection
4784,nicely dry and very crisp with mouthwatering acidity that scours the palate and makes it brisk and clean its a little too fruity though with jammy pineapple lemon and lime flavors that pall after a few sips
4785,nicely dry in the finish with a good bite of acidity and smooth tannins the weakness is a certain thinness of blackberry fruit for the price though you get some elegance
4786,nicely perfumed and elegant this offers aromas of wild berry pressed blue flower and white licorice the young tannins are astringent firm and followed by crisp acidity
4787,nicely rich and crisp this fine sauvignon blanc shows smoky creamy flavors of lemons limes green apples peaches and figs theres a slightly sweet honeyed edge of vanilla but the wine is basically dry

4789,no bargain here but it is a an excellent wine made evident by the spicy minty nose thats packed with attractive nutty nuances coffee and earth ripe and full with fine structure this chianti is fresh seductive and round the cherry and leather flavors are on the money and the tannins are right there
4790,no doubt this is mountain grown zin still tight but revealing nice aromatics of cherry and spicy licorice on the finish accompanied by a healthy helping of espresso wrapped in smooth tannins all around should only get better over the next year or two
4791,no malo in this tight acidic young wine its one of those lemony citrusy flinty chards that will reward aging for 5 or 6 years
4792,no oak on this charming wine so what you get is pure lemon peach and mango fruit flavor its definitely on the rich side and could use greater acidity to balance out the sugary finish
4793,no prizes from portuguese varietal experts for guessing that this is a blend with touriga nacional and franca and tinta roriz the wine itself is rounded soft and sweet with sweet black plums just touched by acidity but more about open tannins and rich dried fruits
4794,no this isnt that complex but it does offer a mouthful of assertive riesling flavor intense notes of green apple lime and honey coat the palate leaving a long slightly sweet finish in their wake drink now
4795,nobilvite merlot and cabernet sauvignon offers slightly disjointed aromas of black fruit and prune backed by green olive and caper theres a touch of sourness on the otherwise short finish
4796,nobody should mistake this idiosyncratic basque white wine for a bargain at 25 you had better like steely almost sourstyle whites to justify going here but if you can find the pleasure in txakoli then this one is good it has peach and nectarine aromas which are backed by tangy lemon and pineapple flavors naturally sharp and cleansing on the finish and thus good for seafood tapas and the like
4797,none of the currentrelease indomita wines have struck a chord including this hard rubbery barnyardy carmenère its semisour sharpedged and tangy with an angular finish and a stinky essence
4798,none of winemaker jenny dobsons wines are shy on flavor this one is loaded with ripe peach fruit buttressed by a healthy dose of toasty french oak which comes across reminiscent of hazelnuts at three years of age this topnotch chard is just entering its primedrinking window and should last another few years
4799,normally grown in the dão region this grape needs poor soil to flourish on its own it makes a powerfully fruity wine packed with red fruits and some flavors of dark chocolate the acidity is intense and needs another few months to settle down
4800,norman conquest get it the wine itself is too soft and lacks the tanninacid structure needed for balance too bad because the oakinfused cherry and blackberry flavors are fine
4801,not a bad chard from this warm central coast region its a little rough around the edges but is dry and creamy with a nice mingling of fruit and oaky elements
4802,not a bad little quaffer from martinezbujanda this colorful ripe red is solid and chunky with sweet aromas of berries and black plum it is what you would call straightforward with little to no complexity but lots of girth finishes full almost creamy
4803,not a bad wine at all has cherryberry fruit with gritty sweet tannins totally dry
4804,not a bad wine but definitely overoaked for what it is the nose bleeds resin and faux milk chocolate while the chunky herbal palate offers pretty good mouthfeel but also roasted berry flavors menthol and herbal notes rise up on the hot finish
4805,not a lot of depth or length but whats here is pretty enough blending peach and pear nectar full and soft easy to drink imported by palm bay imports
4806,not a lot to latch onto here the aromas are sharp and sweaty while the palate feel is more dull than it should be while flavors of melon and pickled fruits are briney
4807,not as compelling as some vintages of this wine have been but still very good the 2008 virgilius features floral and apricot aromas married to wellripened melon and peach flavors its lush broadtextured palate leads into a soft easy finish drink now
4808,not as pricey as the winerys san andreas bottling but in the same style lightbodied elegant dry and modest in alcohol yet with great focus and intensity a lovely wine thats a relative bargain
4809,not as rich or long in the finish as the special select bottling this sweetie shows much of the same character its honeysweet and crisp with apricot peach vanilla and wildflower flavors
4810,not as successful as the winerys other reds this seems overloaded with vanilla scents and flavors the oak overpowers the light fruit and the tannins again quite dry are not set off against anything ripe and sweet to counterbalance their bitterness
4811,not many modernday carmenères are as overtly green and underdone as this which is surprising given that its from warm colchagua and a good vintage but green as a bean or bell pepper it is and theres also some sizzle and scrape to the tannins and mouthfeel shows glimpses of better ripeness and balance but those dont last long enough to turn things around
4812,not many sparklers have anise aromas to match white stone fruits but this 100 chenin blanc has just that and more crisp and lively with citrus fruits flavors especially lemon and lime the wine has firm mineral and some stemmy notes to add character goes to show you can still find good french sparklers for bargain prices
4813,not many winemakers attempt a 100 varietal petit verdot the grape is inky tannic and unyielding and the finish can be tonguetyingly scrapey but os does well by it putting together a steakhouse wine that promises to cut through the fattest juiciest cut of beef you can toss at it its got the fruit tooblue plum cassis boysenberryalong with a dash of black pepper the finish is all black coffee and bourbon
4814,not many wineries make charbono anymore its a bonedry wine strong in tannins and earthy with a resemblance to barbera summers 2008 is quite fine and elegant for the variety with dried berry currant leather coffee and spice flavors it should slowly develop over the next dozen years mellowing and sweetening
4815,not much different than the basic sarria rosado with maybe a touch more concentration and richness the nose is a bit dusty with good berry fruit notes and a whiff of cherry blossom the palate is wet and fresh with raspberry and plumskin flavors crisp and refreshing
4816,not much oak is evident in this polished chardonnay what stars is fruit all pineapples pears tangerines green apples and papayas and the acidity that makes it all bright and clean great with pasta in a butter sauce with garlic and pepper
4817,not one of the best cabs from this venerable winery despite a cool vintage theres a burnt edge to the blackberry pie filling flavors tasted in late 2007 the tannins are very astringent and shut down the palate could show better after 2008
4818,not one to age but to enjoy now for its fresh clean fruitiness its dry silky and pure in raspberries cherries and dr pepper cola with a rich overlay of oak at this price its a steal
4819,not overblown or exaggerated this tight and carefully balanced brunello strikes a chord between power and elegance at its essence are aromas of red fruit forest berry cola mesquite and cedar wood
4820,not overdone or overripe heres a rich chard that boasts fresh peach and red apple notes with notes of tropical fruit acidity clean and solid with a medium mouthfeel an easydrinking choice thats perfect for company
4821,not overly fruity up front instead theres a strong hint of lettuce greens and peach pit on the bouquet the palate is more round and giving with a tropical blend of pineapple citrus and apple flavors finishes dry and firm making it perfectly good in the 12andunder category
4822,not quite dry this is is a warm creamy wine it has fresh lemon juice pineapple bright acidity and a dense texture that bestows an intensely fruity character its ready to drink but will be better at the end of 2014
4823,not quite in the same league as the winerys 03 morisoli cab but at less than half the price a very good cabernet polished and dry its ripe in the modern style and wellstructured in acids and tannins with true varietal flavors of blackberry jam and cherries sweetened with smoky cedar its beautiful now
4824,not quite ripe with a stemmy green streak to the modest cherries and berries finishes dry tart and thin
4825,not quite ripe with green vegetal notes suggesting asparagus this was a cool vintage and the wine is from a cool area
4826,not quite ripe with some veggie notes but otherwise this is a nice polished wine dry fullbodied and spicy with smooth tannins and some good cherry and blackberry fruit
4827,not quite up to the standards set by the 2004 this is nevertheless an excellent shiraz fullbodied and lush blackberry fruit dominates the aromas framed by vanilla and just a touch of dill folds in plenty of earthy complexity on the palate plus hints of cola and coffee making this more than a simple fruitandoak confection drink now2015
4828,not really distinguishable from the winerys regular bottling of sangiovese this too has just a hint of sour cherry with leafy earthy drying tannins
4829,not really dry like the label says but with apricot and orange jam richness sauvignon blanc adds citrus fruit notes and acidity theres also a lot of new oak drink this tasty wine now
4830,not really dry this riesling has an official residual sugar reading of 211 its blended with gewürztraminer muscat canelli chardonnay and viognier the end result is fruity and spicy with flavors of honeysplashed apples citrus fruits and peaches high acidity provides muchneeded crispness
4831,not really pink more of a salmon color and quite sweet with tangerine jelly and vanilla flavors good acidity and superclean winemaking make it balanced and zesty
4832,not short on intensity but it is a little candied and gummy on the nose it remains somewhat jammy in the mouth with a mild creaminess softening up edgy red berry flavors good but candied and basic
4833,not showing many complexities now its a big ripe fruity wine with strong flavors of cherries raspberries and smoky sandalwood wrapped into a silky texture drink now
4834,not showing well now a dry tartly acidic wine with jammy blackberry and cherry flavors feels sharp and angular and fresh the grapes come from the mountain estate vineyard and the wine could develop bottle complexity over the years best to cellar for a good 56 years and try again
4835,not sure why an 03 joven would still be on the market but since it is well review it the bouquet deals cinnamon and rubber along with basic berry aromas while the palate is tangy and racy as it pumps cherry and raspberry fruit full on the finish but modest in flavor and style still seems fresh and ready to go
4836,not terrible aromatic and the flavors are somewhat austere as well offering little more than underripe melon and peach notes clean and stony with hints of apple creeping in on the finish
4837,not that packed or forward but still quite good in its territory the nose shows light cherry while the palate is fairly savory with berry flavors touched up by a shot of vanilla a bit short on the finish and not that full in the middle but for 8 what more do you want imported by gwfcgourmet wine food co
4838,not the stellar value of prior years the 2007 jacobs creek shows low earthy tones and a stingy amount of fruit though a touch of cassis pops up on the short finish drink up
4839,not too bad on the nose but tangy jumpy and overexcited in the mouth with exaggerated nectarine and citrus flavors aggressive after the bouquet with no elegance year after year this wine is lively but fails to impress us
4840,not too refined but still pretty tasty the palate offers chewy cherry and raspberry fruit while the finish is spicy and zesty to the point that it creates a tingle somewhat sugary but definitely an easy one to drink
4841,not too rich or heavy this classic dry wine has plenty of personality emerging from the mint cedar and anise aromas crisp raspberry and cranberry flavors and medium body
4842,not very chardonnaylike more like a viognier or pinot gris with its aromatic floral tropical fruit citrus melon and spice aromas and flavors still its very tasty and dry as well with a crisp spine of minerally acidity
4843,not what youd call a clean direct wine the nose is nutty and dirty while the flavors are underdeveloped vegetal and tart barely worth a look
4844,not what youd call overtly fruity with its charred reduced set of grilled meat and leathery aromas the palate is more fruitladened with raspberry and plum flavors getting a boost from vanilla and cola accents not bad but sort of rubbery and baked in the end
4845,not your usual warmclimate viognier it has typical buttercup acacia and honeysuckle notes but since it was only 20 barrel fermented it isnt a thick wine instead the focus is on apricot white raisin and citrus flavors not yet in the us market but hopefully itll arrive soon
4846,notes of black cherry christmas spice leather moist tobacco honey cedar and barbecue smoke all define the bouquet it is long and smooth with a soft velvety finish
4847,notes of cinnamon and peppercorns adds complexity to the cranberrypomegranate fruit and slate minerality on the nose of this singlevineyard expression its more reserved in its palate which offers cranberry tang with an herbal sagebrush quality proving a reliable straightforward take on the grape
4848,notes of cola earth sassafras and spicy berry bring a textural diverse set of flavors to this mellow pinot noir with a hint of dried herb it shows fine balance and impressive complexity
4849,notes of dried dark berry leathery spice sweet tobacco and chocolatecovered cherry fill the nose of this wine the satiny texture pairs well with the dusty tannins and additional flavors of prune sweet smoke and fresh caramel linger through the mediumlength finish
4850,notes of fresh savory herb and black pepper spice up the plum cherry and blueberry fruit center of this wine a blend of 60 merlot 30 carignan and 10 petit verdot this mediumweight selection offers a rich fruitdriven palate with approachable tannins and a solid finish
4851,notes of honey and baked apple waft curiously amid white floral aromas on this semisweet riesling the perfume can be a tad cloying competing with sweet lychee and pink grapefruit flavors on the palate but white tea on the finish adds elegance and restraint
4852,notes of honeycomb and sugar cookie add a caramelized warmth to ripe tangerine and peach aromas on this aromatic riesling sparkler its intensely floral and fruity on the palate but with hints of maturity and a lasersharp acidity that cuts through rich foamy mousse
4853,notes of light grass green melon rind and a touch of green pepper unfold in the bouquet while the palate boasts more citrusbased flavors of lime and tart gooseberry this is bright and lively with a short mouthwatering finish
4854,notes of orange and lemon preserves on the nose lead into flavors of orange lemon and vanilla on the palate it finishes with a touch of spice
4855,notes of pressed apple and burnt sugar on the nose and palate of this sparkler made entirely of seyval blanc grapes are reminiscent of a dry french apple cider juicy and full bodied with a stout frame and frothy mediumsized bubbles
4856,notes of red berry plum spice bay leaf clove and nutmeg all show on the bouquet this is balanced and offers freshness and a menthol note on the finish
4857,notes of ripe fleshy red fruit on the nose and palate are grazed with hints of smoked meat nuts and dried sagean appetizing mélange of sweet and savory elements while its full bodied the zesty acidity makes for a refreshing yet satisfying sip
4858,notes of savory meat anise crushed black pepper and balsamic on the nose are followed by elegant waves of ripe red fruit and smoke on the palate a successful balance of rich fruit and a briny spicy backbone this is a red thats very good consumed on its own or paired with grilled meats
4859,nothing fancy about this dry plummy wine but it gets the job done shows ripe currant tobacco and herb flavors wrapped into firm tannins
4860,nothing flashy here just straightforward tart fruit flavors leaning to apple white peach and other coolclimate fruit
4861,noticeable oakdriven notes of toasted nuts take center stage and are embellished by delicate tones of stone fruit chestnut honey and yellow flower the oak notes are strong though and take away from the natural fruit make sure to drink very cool otherwise the oak and high alcohol mask everything else
4862,nottingham cellars which is known for producing wines from bordeaux varieties has produced its first set of whites in 2011 this chardonnay is earthy and it offers a crisp lemony character and hints of nut and pear
4863,nova serra opens with a luminous color accented by golden highlights followed by aromas of melon peach and golden delicious apple the wine is silky and creamy on the close and those qualities make it a good partner to shellfish or risotto
4864,now at its peak of maturity this is a gorgeous toast and spice flavored champagne it has richness refined acidity a powerful concentration of yeasty almonds a taut texture and a final flavor that is straight true perfectly balanced
4865,now in its third vintage this complex bordeaux blend which is mostly cabernet sauvignon performs at the height of sebastianis red portfolio mainly from great vineyards in alexander and sonoma valleys its very much in the modern style soft and ripe yet it maintains an elegant dignity and it passes the threepeat test you want a second glass and then a third
4866,now owned by gallo and the game plan seems to be to make simple clean varietal wines with a california appellationat least for now cherries blackberries slightly sweet and simple
4867,now wellestablished as a douro classic this latest vintage of chryseia shows the same concentration and dense tannins while bringing an extra element of elegance and balance this gives the wine obvious aging potential over at least 67 years
4868,now with its intensity and some bottle age this wineformerly known as crémant de cramantis rich with its apple flavor blending with an almond note and a soft warm texture the acidity shoots right through this ripe wine
4869,nuanced expressive and floral this demonstrates balance between the tannins and mushroomkissed bingcherry flavor the palate feels soft silky and round and the layer of dark chocolate is the perfect finishing touch age it for 57 years but it is also enjoyable now
4870,nutty and caramelly this is a great example of aged tawny roasted walnut aromas waft from the glass followed by flavors reminiscent of maple syrup carried across the palate on creamysoft waves of richness
4871,nutty and intense like peanut brittle reduced to liquid formbut with less than half the corn syrup it delivers beautiful texture and intensity its almost fruity but then mushroom almond and macadamia nut take over with perfect weight and a finish that doesnt quit this is a great dry sherry imported by shawross international importers
4872,nutty and melonscented this is a mediumbodied chardonnay with distinct tangerine and spice components lohr attributes to the muscat clone used in this wine finishes with a flourish of buttery richness this would pair beautifully with cold crab
4873,nutty aromas break up and lose cleanliness with airing this is a wine in decline its mealy and fairly woody with not a lot happening at moments it hints at mature quality but mostly it lacks steam
4874,nutty aromas of almond skins and walnut arent terribly fruity but show some mineral cut the wine is punchy but standard in feel with a mix of citrus and melon flavors the finish tastes nutty and a bit briny
4875,nutty flavors of new oak signal a more international style of pinot but the underlying fruit speaks eloquently of ripe red cherry and offers glimpses of raspberry subtle spice plays around the edges the palate is rounded and soft but has a refreshing vein of acidity
4876,nutty peachy aromas similar flavors plus flashes of white pepper come through on the palate wide and soft but not full easy but not profound imported by fosters wine estates americas
4877,oak aging with 25 new french barrel has helped shape sweet aromas of vanilla and exotic spice backed by loads of cherry and ripe forest berry characteristic aromas of violets wet earth and graphite appear at the back and the wine is firm thick and smooth on the close consider long cellar aging 10 years or more
4878,oak completely overwhelms this wine all you can smell and taste is char caramel and wood spice and the tannins which are partly from oak barrels are dense and hard its difficult even to discern any underlying fruit flavors although if you try hard you stumble across blackberries
4879,oak density and medicinal berry aromas are the three most prominent characteristics on the nose of this carbonic macerated tempranillo in the mouth its full and a bit grabby flavors of smoky oak and hickory vie with blackfruit tastes while the finish is firm and dry with residual woodiness
4880,oak dominates this wine towering over everything else and offering a strong dose of caramel hardened by wood tannins there are some good cherry and red currant flavors but theyre swamped by the barrel regimen disappointing for this fine carneros vineyard
4881,oak in the way of vanilla and buttered toast dominates underneath are simple pineapple and apricot flavors that are watered down on the finish
4882,oak knoll is a value producer sourcing its fruit close to the winery and emphasizing that fruit in simple pleasant wines such as this pinot gris citrus and melon flavors light and rather delicate make this a good choice for a simple midweek meal best buy
4883,oak leaf tart strawberry and supple vanilla aromas appear immediately on the nose and continue their smooth interplay on the mellow palate this is pliable in texture but has depth backbone and inherent freshness delicious now it has an underlying taut structure that will benefit from some bottle age drink 20182025
4884,oak stars in this chardtoo much oak in fact vanilla char wood sap woody spice and smoke tastes dominate the tropical fruit peach and citrus flavors
4885,oak treatment adds a caramel spice to the crisp cirtic flavors of roditis the nose sweeter and slightly headier than the untreated version leads into a pretty rounded fruit profile that marries the oaky spice and lemon character well more dimension and less lift than the average greek white
4886,oakier than tscheppes regular bottling but ultimately not any more pleasurable toasty mealy scents mask peach and melon flavors the mouthfeel is thick and rich finishes with a hint of alcohol and a strong taste of nutty oak imported by winemonger
4887,oaky and appealing with blackberry currant chocolate and oaky flavors that finish in a swirl of peppery spice this dry wine was blended with a bit of syrah and petite sirah

4892,obsession delivers aromas of blackberry and plum with pretty accents of spice and tobacco at the back the palate is thick and dense with tight tannins and loads of dark fruit intensity
4893,obviously shaped by a hot vintage this riserva delivers bold notes of black cherry plum dried prunes old leather and exotic spice the bold intensity of these aromas causes them to lose some definition the wine shows more determination in the mouth however thanks to its power and rich concentration
4894,obviously wellgrown and wellmade this pinot is totally dry and balanced with a wealth of currant plum pomegranate and cola flavors spiced with powerful cinnamon nutmeg and pepper it has a tannic toughness that suggests future possibilities best from late 2009 through 2012

4896,oceanic aromas of grass scallion baby garlic and lime reflect coolcoast origins a slick juicy mouthfeel is minerally while this offers flavors of nettle lime passion fruit and green onion a long stony finish leans towards green flavors
4897,odd aromas of pomegranate and grapefruit are off the grid this is citric and austere in feel with sour herbal flavors mixed with oak a minty herbal green finish raises questions
4898,odd stuff with honeyed sweet greenpea aromas and flavors suggestive of older new zealand sauvignon turning lemony on the finish
4899,oddly sweet and medicinal with sugary apricot and orange soda flavors and deficient acidity
4900,of the winerys current crop of five syrahs this is the next most expensive but its hard to tell why possibly because most of the grapes come from napa valley they paid more for fruit but that means nothing the wine is tannic and has a glyceriney sweetness to the blackberry and cherry fruit thats almost syrupy doesnt seem like an ager
4901,offdry in honey orange and peach flavors but balanced by crisp acidity this is a pleasant everyday sipper
4902,offdry this has solid flavors suggesting cracker and grain honey and melon its a flavorful sturdy take on riesling but does not have the pretty floral character

4904,offdry with initial flavors of orange candy and a slight medicinal graininess it develops some honeyed lemon in the midpalate and smoothes into a pleasantdrinking low alcohol and high acid riesling
4905,offering none of the oaky fruity richness of popular chardonnays this bottle needs to be figured out in a different way its superdry acidic and minerally with citrus fruit flavors that seem barely touched by oak its a wine of structural integrity made in the style of a great chablis one of the rare chardonnays that should age

4916,offers very soft fruit open and rounded there is some acidity some flavor of melon and pears complemented with toast and an edge of citrus the finish is lightly mineral
4917,oh what a nice young cabernet this is with lots of new french oak it shows a beautifully balanced elegant opulence the fruit is impeccably ripe all blackberries and cassis and the allimportant tannins are softly ripe and sweet you could open it now but it should develop additional bottle complexity after 2007
4918,oily and citrusy with pungent almost nutty aromas that are at once exotic but simultaneously funky and sour the palate hits with chopping passion fruit and citrus but theres also some banana to contemplate in the end its just too hard to embrace and go beyond a sip or two which isnt a great testimonial
4919,oily aromas include sulfur and matchstick the palate is full and bulky what some might label cloying the flavors are pure pineapple syrup while the finish is very sweet teeters toward unctuous

5115,pejus regular napa cab sometimes seems to take second seat to their reserve and singlevineyard bottlings thats how it is with this good but average bottling plays it right down the middle with ripe blackberry flavors and quite a bit of sweet oak
5116,pendulum is a collaboration with allen shoup long shadows and that plus the fact that this 1500case red wine is a mix of eight different varieties suggests that it is crafted from barrels that did not make the final blend for long shadows there is plenty of expensive toasty new oak in the nose cedar and smoke and black olive also but the wine doesnt really have any focus pleasant especially for the new oak

5142,perhaps the quintessential dry creek cabernet theres a zinlike briary brambly feeling and the blackberries have a strong herbal component while the finish is awash in peppery spices the tannins too are classic dry creek furry and edgy a lovely wellstructured wine thats the opposite of the modern napa style
5143,perhaps this wine is showing the effects of 2003s torrid summer but it doesnt show the fresh vibrant fruit that characterizes the best soaves its still a good serviceable drink but one that relies on a certain weight in the mouth and baked apple flavors bolstered by a grapefruity finish
5144,perry creek has done a nice job on this viognier it has a pretty very floral nose and its aromatics make it inviting throughout a small percentage of marsanne and roussanne coming through mediumbodied it just finishes a percentage too sweet to taste truly balanced

5149,picked and vinified expressly for this rosé the grapes were sourced from the armada vineyard it has a pale copperlike onionskin shade it is aged for a year longer than most rosés but it has lost none of its freshness the pretty strawberry note gains complexity and textural interest as it lingers on the palate persistent focused leesy and long this elegant rosé looks deceptively light but offers powerful flavors
5150,picked quite ripe the resulting wine features mainly melon and fig aromas and flavors with very little grassiness in evidence crisp acidity on the finish provides the vivacity needed to pair with oysters or clams

5154,pie cherry and rhubarb notes make a bright impression on the nose followed by tart flavors bundled in a mochatinged wrapper the texture is almost syrupy on the midpalate but turns dry and dusty on the finish this is a bit disjointed at this stage so perhaps it will improve with cellaring try after 2018
5155,piercing jabbing aromas of wood and berry fruits lead to a juicy acidic fresh feeling palate with light oaky generic flavors of minty berry herbs and oak a modest oaky finish is undistinguished
5156,piercing to start with leathery bacony and campfire aromas saturated although healthy if a bit hard and tannic flavors of bacon and clove are right up there with black fruit and syupy richness and clove carries onto the finish needs time to breathe and unfold 65 garnacha and 35 syrah

5365,quite a nice cabernet sauvignon from this veteran producer but be warned its very tannic theres a hard astringency that locks it down but underneath that is beautifully ripened blackberry and cherry fruit will it age probably not for more than 46 years when the tannins will still be there
5366,quite a nice wine dry and soft with a lush generous mouthfeel that conveys rich cherry chocolate and oak flavors theres a touch of overripe raisins and the finish is a bit hot
5367,quite aggressive and murky at first with a gassy heavy bouquet of leather earth and cooked plums a lot of dryness comes out on the palate courtesy of starchy tannins and mediumweight red fruit finishes with grip size and a heavy hand for best results give it as much time as you can
5368,quite an interesting wine that shows the hallmarks of a fine napa cab but is a bit lighter in body and more cherried dry and velvety with smooth tannins it will play well against a grilled steak with mushroom sauce
5369,quite dark for a rosé and very extracted with a thick cherry taste thats fine for a red but a bit heavy and dense for a blush
5370,quite delicious and loaded with wild berry flavors and herbal highlights this impressive wine is almost pure mourvèdrejust 4 syrah was blended in twenty months in a mix of hungarian french and american oak has begun to soften its rather hard and slightly stemmy tannins further agingup to five yearsis recommended
5371,quite dilute with gaseous chemical aromas that subside with time but never really leave the palate is dry mulchy and briney and dig as you might there is never much fruit to latch onto too thin even for a cool year like 2007
5372,quite dry all stainless fermentation with plenty of herbal components as the wine rounds into maturity it develops some pretty cotton candy scents as it warms in the glass also
5373,quite dry and bracing this crisp white wine shows celery and root flavors with a mix of dried herbs and plenty of acidity
5374,quite dry on the palate this seems less ripe than the previous vintage the opening flavors are dominated by earth and stemrather than fruitfollowed by notes of baking spice coconut and caramel
5375,quite earthy and ripe as tree bark leather and prune make up the bouquet the mouth is lively and snappy with red fruit taking over and holding reign sheer zesty and juicy describes the mouthfeel while overall the wine delivers depth and integrity not overly complex but very good and straightforward
5376,quite floral with aromas of sweet pea peach cherry and raspberry with a hint of chalky minerality mediumfull yet brisk in the mouth with dominating cherry flavors backed by notes of nectarine pit
5377,quite generic and arguably overoaked given the wines core quality the nose smells rubbery and then milky while the palate is jammy and sticky with sweet candied oaky fruit flavors in our opinion its too resiny and done up in woodspice and thus the fruit never shines not nearly as good as tosos basic malbec
5378,quite green and on the verge of deserving the dreaded weedy designation this cab fails to show much ripe fruit character even if the mouthfeel is decent its like a wetvintage cru bourgeois bordeaux
5379,quite international in style a direct reflection of the merlot cabernet sauvignon and syrah components that comprise the wine that said this is probably the best wine martinez bujanda has made at its la mancha winery its plump and ripe with nice cherry and plum flavors its medium in weight and length and juicy likable as can be imported by civusa

5381,quite minty and herbal but balanced somewhat by cherry blackberry and vanilla flavors a mediumweight quaffer with a fresh cinnamon note to the finish
5382,quite nice on the nose with bold plum cassis and smoky aromas its more narrow than expected on the palate with blackberry plum and other bright fruit flavors the attack is excellent but the second act is less impressive it finishes sort of drab but overall there are no gripes when it comes to the fruit content
5383,quite pale and thin you search in vain for any substance here a wine this light must have some ephemeral grace this just seems empty and oddly a bit hot
5384,quite pale for a pinot noir and with a lilting delicately silky mouthfeel but theres nothing light about the flavors which are intricate as a tapestry the cherries raspberries orange peel and vanilla have an herbal edge of rosehip tea and rhubarb pie now through 2012

5386,quite sweet on the nose with mango and cantaloupe sort of syrupy and soft with plump but basic citrus flavors finishes heavy with a fleshy freshness and medium acidity imported by laird company

5394,raisin pastry and plum aromas are smooth and generous given how cool 2013 was in rioja theres good acidity and body to go with flavors of plum blackberry and toasty oak finishing notes of coffee toast and chocolate are fully oaked which lends a sense of sweetness to this crianza

5414,rather pulpy in texture but the flavors are fresh and fruity with bold notes of pineapple lime and fruit salad crisp and clean on the finish

5416,rather restrained for a muscatbased wine with modest citrus notes dominating this soft offdry sparkler simple but clean and well made
5417,rather roughhewn at the age of fourplus years with charred vanillascented oak dominating the fruit below that is a sea of blackberries cherries and currants the tannins are tough and sharp not showing particularly well now and could gain in the bottle may be better after 2011
5418,rather simple like a blackberryinfused cola punch its the kind of red wine to serve at a party and everybody will like it but theres not a whole lot going on right now could develop in the bottle

6000,smells a bit heavy oily and like dry cornflakes the palate is straightforward with tropical candied flavors of mango banana and sweet melon sweetness is the key here its all over the palate and finish
6001,smells a bit leathery with pleasant anise sassafras and sour cherry notes chiming in its a wine of intriguing spice complexity but ultimately not much fruity flesh drink now

6003,smells a little tanky and dull tastes quite sweet like sugared peach and pineapple juice

6008,smells and tastes like a pleasing mix of white stone fruit citrus and rainwater feels fresh on the palate though not as concentrated as i would like imported by pacific wine partners
6009,smells and tastes not quite ripe now that the wine is softening and resolving at the age of 312 years its showing a streak of veggie green behind the cherries
6010,smells and tastes sweet like a baked cherry tart with the gooey filling and the sweet smoky crust this is a serious deficiency in a table wine
6011,smells and tastes ungenerous probably due to unripe grapes that give an earthy vegetal taste to the wine not going anywhere so drink up

6223,soliloquy was a hit from the very start and the wine has become steadily more interesting and complex as the sourcing shifted to oakville now 100 singlevineyard sauvignon blanc from the musqué clone its dry elegant and crisp with a ripe finish to the fig key lime and white peach flavors sur lies aging adds a mouthwatering creaminess
6224,some banyuls can be pruny but this version from the rhônebased firm of chapoutier is remarkably fresh the wines sweet plummy fruit features herbal touches on the nose but also enough cocoalike flavors to pair with chocolate and a softly dusty texture to the finish
6225,some bright black currant flavors are found on a wine that feels light and fresh with some spice and a high acid content
6226,some extra barrel time and single vineyard status separate this wine from eraths regular bottling this has narrow flavors of green apple and white peach not showing much new oak influence
6227,some flinty notes precede earthier ripe apple notes that also spread across the palate there is a textured mouthfeel while a clean seam of lemon crispness counters the earthy fruit texture and freshness linger pleasantly
6228,some good currant cherry cola and licorice flavors in this dry balanced wine its one of the better merlots out there at this affordable price
6229,some good things are going on with this wine including abundant red fruit and a soft feel however the wood overpowers them with strong aromas and flavors of vanilla dill and coconut along with a bitter note that distracts
6230,some grapes should not be forced together this is a sweaty aggressive white with citrus and grapefruit flavors and a bullish feel underwhelming despite being big in size
6231,some green herbal flavors thin down the apricots and peaches in this simple wine while the oaky overlay is too strong for the meager fruit
6232,some mousy aromas but along with that there is good black cherry fruit this has plenty of concentration though flavors are onedimensional with toast and mocha in the finish
6233,some of the freshness is already going and the wine is morphing into pear and peach juice flavors there is still an apple skin texture to give some crispness
6234,some panelists praised this chardonnays balance and zingy citrus flavors others were put off by its potent even overwhelming oak and green woody aspects its fullbodied and there are pleasant pear lime and butterscotch notes fighting for space on the palate give it a year or two and judge for yourself
6235,some pinots can handle high alcohol this one feels hot and sweet not in sugar but in alcohol and glycerine it merits this score because the tartlike cherry cocoapuff and cinnamon flavors taste good but it really needs greater balance
6236,some producers are promoting petit verdot as a top performer in australias warm inland regions but there have been mixed results this blend is almost half pv presumably the source of its bold blackolive aromas and crisp mouthfeel partially balanced by the cassis and plum of warmclimate cabernet
6237,some slightly smoky barrelchar aromas are subtle enough to allow rosepetal notes to slip through backed by assertive flavors of cherries and toasty oak this is a fairly fullbodied spicy pinot that pleases upfront before quickly slipping away
6238,some very appealing apple asian pear mint smoke and toast notes mark the nose of this even mediumweight wine it has fine fruittoacid balance and offers applepeach flavors with a mild but evident butterscotch element the tangy oak thats present from the start shows most prominently on the spicy finish
6239,some wines can hit 154 alcohol as this does and make it work but here the burn and scorch from the alcohol simply overwhelms some excellent fruit detail is lost and whats left is a hot jammy red
6240,something of a fruit bomb with massive cherry raspberry currant mocha and granola flavors wrapped into a lightly tannic body brisk acidity fortunately provides balance to the fruit drink now
6241,something of a letdown after the toprank showing of the 2006 the 2007 is marked by a slightly sour lactic character which accentuates the wines sweetcorn fruit the mouthfeel is creamy and soft maybe a little too softso drink it over the next few months
6242,sometimes franc can have a lovely alluringly floral bouquet other times it can be downright vegetal and display greenbean characteristics unfortunately this is an example of the latter the wine has nice weight and texture so if you dont mind your veggies in liquid form this might be more to your liking
6243,sometimes in a challenging vintage such as 2009 it is the least expensive blended wines that benefit most perhaps because grapes normally destined for the singlevineyard wines are redirected here rich fruit flavors highlighted with streaks of caramel and toffee get things rolling quickly berries and cherries firm acids pretty spice and a lingering butterscotch finish
6244,sometimes you want the richness of a rosé sparkler and with this pinot noir and chardonnay blend you get plenty of flavor although its dry its flamboyant in raspberries strawberries and vanilla along with the stimulating yeast of a great bubbly just great on its own or drink with sushi or roast salmon
6245,somewhat complex as it begins with heavy bacon and tire rubber aromas that ultimately give way to more floral notes fairly thick on the palate with sweet red fruits glycerol and tannins finishes a touch flat and sugary with some portlike heat a hard one to peg
6246,somewhat crude and angular now but then again its petite sirah and mountaingrown at that shows considerable tannins and fresh acidity with compact flavors of wild black and blue berries licorice currants and peppery spices finshed with a flourish of dark chocolate a very fine wine that needs time better after 2012
6247,somewhat hard edged this is as dry as possible hinting at toast as well as lentils and quince the acidity is balanced but the wine shies away from the pleasure factor
6248,somewhat rustic and coarse with sweet jammy berry and new oak flavors and a soft melted mouthfeel its an easy wine for everyday fare
6249,somewhat sharp and angular in the mouth but other than that a pretty good glass of syrah its dry and ripe in blackberry and cherry compote mochachoca bacon and pepper flavors leading to a long spicy finish and the tannins are pure and wonderful
6250,somewhat sharp and tartly aggressive now in jammy fruit with raspberry cherry wintergreen mint and cola flavors sweetened with smoky wood notes doe not seem like an ager so drink now with very rich meats oils and cheeses to soften the hardness
6251,somewhat sharp in acids and tannins with a streak of green mint that weakens the blackberry and cherry flavors good structure but a bit unripe and unbalanced and not likely to age
6252,somewhat soft and jammy while its certainly delicious this 100 cabernet needs greater structure and complexity to add value to the sweet blackberries cherries and chocolate
6253,somewhat volatile aromas suggest stems and a bit of nail polish before the herbal fruit surfaces this chewy tannic wine does not live up to its single vineyard promise
6254,somewhere in all the sugar there is a crisp subtlely fruity roussanne with citrus pear and wildflower flavors but the sweetness buries everything else
6255,sophie is an expression of chardonnay from the mountainous alto adige region of northern italy with small components of viognier and sauvignon blanc to accent the floral liveliness of the bouquet this oakaged wine opens with a creamy offgold appearance and offers solid heft and persistency on the finish
6256,sort of dry and cheesy smelling at first but more fruity as you get to know it the palate is lean dry and evaporates fast but along the way the cherry and olive flavors are solid with some vanilla thrown in for good measure about as much as you should expect for 7
6257,sort of generic and oily on the nose with whitefruit aromas that dont fully register the palate is both spongy and spritzy with dry soft flavors of melon and papaya more fluffy and lush than zesty and precise
6258,sort of sweet and gaseous to start with rubbery medicinal aromas the palate is tight and closed with warm crusty darkfruit flavors an herbal influence and heat thus the finish is a little fiery and peppery and theres chop and bite to the overall feel a kitchensink blend of malbec bonarda and syrah
6259,sound and dry if a bit thin with fleeting flavors of berries and cherries accented with oak its good in every way but needs greater concentration of fruit

6279,sparkling wines like this dosaggio zero made from 5050 chardonnay and pinot nero show the best of the territory they come from and promise to pair with a long list of foods this example offers tones of citrus stone fruit and almond the wine is never heavy or too dense
6280,spearmint and dry red fruit carry the nose the palate shows basic sweet cherry and strawberry flavors but not much cabernet character all in all its a strippedback wine that offers rudimentary redfruit character
6281,spearmint and herbal darkfruit aromas lend an ominous touch to the bouquet which isnt followed upon nor improved by the firm raspberry and cherry flavors that control the palate black pepper and heat add fire to the finish not a big success at this price the altum syrah is much more likable

6418,strong accents of mint tomato leaf and clove tannic and earthy theres a core of leafy earthy spice but the fruit doesnt show much ripeness
6419,strong and aggressive this dark and almost syrupy syrah crosses the line from hightoned to volatile the californiastyle grapey fruit flavors of plum and blueberry should warrant a higher score but for some tasters the volatility will be too much
6420,strongly extracted and oaky this cab isnt showing much finesse now it has jammy piefilling blackberry and cherry flavors liberally spiced and wrapped into chewy tannins will age without developing complexity
6421,strongly flavored in wild berries tobacco and cola this also has a vegetal note lurking around the edges its likeable for its dryness and firm tannins which should perform well with a steak

6423,strongly oaky at first sniff this barrelfermented reserve went through complete malolactic fermentation and a year and a half of barrel aging the complexity comes out as it breathes open a mélange of nuanced fruit including guava peach pineapple and green apple skin phenolics from wholecluster pressing add some bite to the lengthy finish
6424,strongs symmetry almost qualifies as a cabernet sauvignon with 71 of that variety and the rest consisting of merlot malbec and petit verdot the meritage labeling identifies it as their supreme bottling of a bordeauxstyle wine easily the best symmetry ever it is a great wine dry and somewhat astringent in tannins it has an impressively deep core of blackberries and currants with an array of sweet herbs chocolate and tobacco its delicious now and should slowly develop bottle complexities over the next 10 years
6425,structure and elegance mark this fine blend of cabernet sauvignon cabernet franc and merlot the blackberry cherry and black currant flavors are nicely ripe yet the wine modulates them with crisp acidity and tannins that have a bite of astringency which of course suggests roasts and grilled steaks a lovely wine thats best now and through 2012
6426,structured and firm with tannins and some element of wood there is sweetness here flavors of licorice blackberry juice and lively sweetness the whole wine is dominated by delicious berry fruits
6427,stunning combines the fleshy opulence of a sweetly youthful pinot with the balanced tightness and acidity of a young cellarworthy one no small feat from a cool vintage in a cool appellation thats increasingly known for pinot noir the wine is pale in color and delicate in the mouth yet powerful in cherrycola and spice intensity gorgeous now and should improve for six years before slowly bowing out
6428,stunning explodes with the most intricately detailed aromas a perfume of fine smoky oak and ripe black currants exudes sheer power with great weight yet no heaviness lush and delicious but just tannic enough if you can wait cellar until 2008 it should hold and improve for many years

6434,stylistically and individually this is not what this critic is looking for in albariño the wine is moderately but noticeably oaked and seeing that it dates from 2003 it has aged to the point that theres butterscotch and cannedcorn aromas reminiscent of warmclimate chardonnay lots of vanilla and butterscotch work the finish and the acidity seems forced not poorly made but not really what albariño should be
6435,stylistically this is at odds with what i feel albariño should be that said its a wellexecuted and wellmade barrelfermented white with fullforce toast and popcorn aromas followed by a resiny vanillafueled flavor profile that folds in apple banana and creamy frosting still vital and healthy after three years in bottle
6436,subdued aromas suggesting stewed plum mature berry dried herb and scorched earth lead the nose the straightforward rather evolved palate offers dried cherry cranberry leather clove and a green note of powdered sage alongside tightly wound tannins that clench the finish

6441,subtle but luscious notes of mirabelle plum ripe greengage and peach lend a seductive touch to this taut structured and beautifully textured wine whose palate is reminiscent of bot fresh apple peel and grapefruit zest covers of fruit are tautly spread across spokes of acidity creating a wonderful tension that keeps you wanting more authentic in its appeal its delicious now but will drink well until at least 2025
6442,subtle floral aromas and whiffs of tropical fruit lead to a lean palate that offers peach papaya and mango alongside bright acidity pair it with lightly seasoned seafood dishes
6443,subtle greenapple aromas and rich ripe pear flavors make a pretty convincing argument for this fullbodied but softtextured wine
6444,subtle on the nose with restrained berry cherry and citrus peel aromas the palate is a little grabby but mostly fresh in its approach with flavors of fresh berry fruit light and mildly candied on the finish a nobrainer thats easy as they come
6445,subtle smoke hovers above earthy notes and the nose only holds the faintest suggestion of citrus the palate comes forth with a vivid leafy purity that suggests herbs freshly turned earth and pure lifted citrus all we get right now are the flavors hovering above the core which is still firmly closed a wealth of apple and citrus fruit is evoked which will awake with time this is too young to be opened dont touch before 2018 and then drink until 2030 or even beyond this is dry delicate and yet powerful with a supremely clean finish
6446,sugary and oaky a simple wine that doesnt do much to promote livermore valley tastes like sweetened pineapple and pear juice

6470,surprisingly flat smelling and borderline oxidized with jammy berry aromas setting up a chunky palate with herbal berry and candied flavors lacks clarity and does not rise to the occasion

6643,the 08 oro is cab dominant while the 07 favored shiraz a difference that seems to be an improvement rich and concentrated with lovely dark plum cassis and black raspberry components coupled with accents of tree bark sweet spice and soft cigar tobacco fresh and lush all at once easy to drink now or can hold for a year or two

6646,the 2003 version of the estate zinfandel clocks in at just 155 alcohol but carries a fair amount of volatile nail polish aromas it is marinated in new oakfrench american hungarianso that whisky barrel scents and flavors cover up any taste of the varietal fruit
6647,the 2004 bricco riund riserva makes a very nice first impression thanks to the elegant and fine nature of its aromas theres a definite aromatic lift here spurred forward by buoyant aromas of root beer cherry menthol white stone and dried currants give it a few more years in the bottle to soft those firm tannins
6648,the 2004 gives some easy aromas of milk chocolate mint herbs olives and eucalyptus as it opens the tannins get stickier and the flavors of chocolate plum cassis and tobacco expand on the finish look for vanilla and good herbal length
6649,the 2004 is 89 cabernet sauvignon 11 merlot and 100 new french oak theres plenty of fruit to back up the lavish oak treatment but this wine needs 35 years to integrate its cassis fruit with the overlay of vanilla chocolate and toasted coconut it seems a bit coarsely textured at first then smoothes out nicely with air gaining length on the finish drink 20082015
6650,the 2005 clos de betz explodes from the glass with profound scents of pipe tobacco violets cherries and clove immediately supple and silky this delicious blend of 56 merlot 19 cabernet sauvignon 16 malbec and 9 cabernet franc offers more complexity than any clos de betz to date silky tightly packed fruit flavors are seamlessly blended with berries currants and cherries galore the tannins have been buffed to a fine lustre

6652,the 2006 chertsey is a blend of 49 cabernet sauvignon 47 merlot 4 cabernet franc and 100 french oak the oaks vanilla and cedar notes provide a foundation for the wines cassis and plum flavors cosseting them in soft tannins drink now2018
6653,the 2006 vintage was not kind to beringers cabernets and this esteemed bottling is no exception its tough and gritty the kind of wine that may have a future but whose present is not particularly acceptable at this price extreme tannins lock it down tastes almost oldfashioned but it does have a rich vein of blackberries and black currants and who knows it could come around after many years

6655,the 2008 pinots from ken wright display their individual terroirs quite succinctly with little evidence of the roughly 30 new oak they receive the abbott claim has a bit more of a chocolaty flavor with full spicy cherry fruit at its core in fact there is so much fruit spicy and candied that it is a bit like fruitcake in a good way

6660,the 600foot schützner stein broods over the neusiedlersee a great place to grow blaufränkisch blended with merlot this is impressive a powerhouse of dense tannins and black fruit the acidity shows through but the wine is as much about extreme concentration it needs aging over 5 years and more
6661,the 7 viognier goes a long way the big bright boost of citrus and acidity dominates the syrah itself is soft and plummychocolaty with a smear of tannins

6673,the aroma shows old wood flavors that dont work on the palate the wood also gives some bitterness that needs to disappear to bring out the best of the red fruits its probably always going to be on the hard side
6674,the aromas are earthy rich in moist soil the palate is just as rich a full opulent wine powered with yellow fruits and a light touch of spice
6675,the aromas are sort of mealy and flat and frankly the palate keeps that tune theres pulpy white fruit and then a flatlining finish that tastes of dried peach and melon
6676,the aromas are surprisingly light for the variety with notes of ripe pear and peach its full bodied with sweet fruit flavors and a rounded creamy feel leading to a warm finish

6680,the aromas of fresh cut apples are so strong that this could easily pass for apple cider in a blind tasting its low alcohol high acid and quite unusual
6681,the aromas of herbs are surprisingly light the stone fruit flavors are broad with tart lemony acids the variety seems impossible for find

6685,the aviator red is a wellcrafted blend that mixes strawberry raspberry pepper and stone in an effective balance that seems to draw the best from each grape for a modest everyday wine this works quite well
6686,the awatere is a subregion of marlborough receiving more and more notice for its distinctive sauvignons and pinots vavasour was an early pioneer and the 2007 is especially successful offering up some slightly sweaty nettley aromas to go along with hints of ripe melons and nectarines its nicely concentrated with a slightly oily mouthfeel and good persistence
6687,the bacalhôa quinta is more famed for its cabernetbased red here sémillon and sauvignon blanc continue the bordeaux connection a superrich wine although the creamy full texture is beautifully balanced with a good layer of citrus fullbodied stylish
6688,the back label notes that this fruit is from the whistling ridge vineyard its rich and concentrated a mix of apple pear and green banana creamy and dense it coats the mouth and lingers deliciously
6689,the basic cuvée from misiones may be the best value of its wines because it is deep and earthy with only the slightest herbal character the palate has dark meaty fruit flavors but also good balance not overly complex but the blackberry and herbal plum notes are on the money
6690,the beautiful orange pink sunrise color sets the scene for a dry style of wine very much in the laurentperrier tradition flavors of crisp red apples red berry fruits and white currants come together with an edge of toast a great wine and a real food champagne

6716,the bouquet deals some peach custard and a slight hint of oak while the palate runs racy fresh and citrusy if you like a fresher style with strong orange and tropical fruit flavors this is your ticket its a controlled wine that meets expectations with 15 parellada
6717,the bouquet delivers some of that creamy cornlike smell that many cavas show there is also cereal and citrus to the nose flavors of nectarine grapefruit and green herbs are fresh and in the lead and the feel is softedged shows some green bitterness on the finish
6718,the bouquet enters into the land of exotic with aromas of sandalwood and cinnamon but from there the wine loses steam offering only basic plum and berry flavors followed by an earthy almost murky finish doesnt show enough in the middle and late stages to rate better imported by american wine distributors
6719,the bouquet has a distinct lemon pine and herb element along with black fruit and mocha its fairly snappy and tannic with clipping bite but also fresh floral flavors of blueberry and herbs toasty and long on the finish with some herbal leftovers and licorice by all evidence available 2006 was a great vintage for bierzo reds
6720,the bouquet here is redolent of pressed flowers red rose violets and dark berry fruit in fact the aromas are so floral they actually resemble potpourri or scented candle youll taste power and alcohol embedded within the wines firm structure
6721,the bouquet here sports popcorn and butter but also zesty tropical fruit and apple blossom aromas the palate is rich but balanced with pear and toffee flavors warm and woody throughout but with such firm acidity its a winner
6722,the bouquet is a mishmash of tomato barrel char plum and pine and together it doesnt exactly sing the palate is jammy and sweet and oak comes up aggressively on the back end by the time the wine finishes all you have is mouth full of spicy oak which some folks weaned on this flavor might very well enjoy

6727,the bouquet of yellow rose apricot pear and cantaloupe is delightful on the palate its creamy and rich and it should pair well with shrimp risotto

6731,the bull continues to offer reasonably good value featuring bold fruit aromas and plenty of flavor intensity for the price cassis and tobacco are the main elements dressed up by hints of mint coffee and chocolate and framed by some firm slightly rough tannins a solid steakhouse red
6732,the bussia cru boasts elegant feminine wines and this expression is no exception youll get tight aromas of blue flower cassis wet earth and white chocolate the wine is elegant and silky on the close the young tannins need another five years of cellar aging to soften

6734,the caudalies vintage comes from old vinesat least 50 years old this 1999 is creamy rich very soft it has apricots ripe fruits very open generous and deliciously ready to drink
6735,the ceretto was surprisingly evolved for a 2006 a big ripe rich wine with flavors of pear lychee and a hint of lime peel structurally this is a wine that probably wont hold up well but at the moment it is a pleasant wine just make sure you drink it over the next few months
6736,the cherry aromas and flavors here already have an aged quality some nice spicy accents conspire to keep it alive but it closes rather tart and woody doesnt show the depth expected in a riserva
6737,the cherry fruit shows mature earth and mushroom accents some coffee and leather notes on the palate add interest and mild tannins on the finish wrap up the package its graceful but also seems advanced for its age
6738,the clean brisk mouthfeel gives this slightly oaked sauvignon blanc instant likeability its dry with a rich streak of honey that sweetens the citrus pear and tropical fruit flavors pair this with asian fare ham or a green salad with grapefruit sections
6739,the clean look nice bead and good mouthfeel are the saving graces here because it smells strange almost like steamed ballpark hot dogs and it tastes odd and innocuous like papaya juice the look and feel are good but the smell and tastes are not so great
6740,the climate of new mexico seems to suit the viognier grape here it has given it a lovely intense perfume of gardenia orange blossom and guava though broad and soft in the mouth enough acid comes through on the finish to save it from flabbiness serve as an apéritif
6741,the colli euganei is an upandcoming wine region located in a volcanic chain of hills outside the city of padua this expression of moscato is sweet and enduring with aromas of yellow rose and jasmine
6742,the color and mouthfeel is fine but the aromas and flavors offer more bramble and vegetal characteristics than is ideal so while it flows nicely the flavor profile gets stuck on jalapeño tomato leaf and green tobacco but mouthfeel is not an issue its a chewy statuesque sort of red 1100 cases made
6743,the color is light but the monchiero has pungent earthy aromas over a backdrop of fruit on the palate it is soft and quite chunky and dominated by its earthiness the wine has evolved completely and should be drunk reasonably quickly
6744,the color of slightly faded garnet this wine has a bouquet of cassis and green pepper chalky tannins create a backdrop for flavors of tart cherry lingonberry bell pepper and petrol that make promises to the taste buds but fall short of delivering
6745,the combination of stainlesssteel and oakbarrel fermentation has been good for this wine its bright and steely in acidity and lifts the varietys mineral and citrus flavors to new heights adding a rich level of smoky cream just beautiful and versatile at the table a sommeliers dream wine production was a mere 850 cases
6746,the complexity starts with dusty mineral tones that slowly segue into perfectly mature blackberry balsam tones and spicy oak notes at the end it is that amazing evolution of aromas which reads like a storybook of tuscany that makes this wine a standout
6747,the concentrated big blackberry fruit is almost over the top but deftly brought into balance thanks to more austere nuances of licorice black tar and worn leather the wine leaves a big impact in the mouth thanks to its good structure and length
6748,the concentration and richness of oldvine pinot gris is all here this is definitely a wine on the sweet side going for superripe peaches white apricots gorgeous spice and not much in the way of acidity revel in this wine for its opulence
6749,the cool 2011 growing season seems to have presented a ripeness issue for this merlot which includes a healthy dollop of cabernet sauvignon along with syrah and cabernet franc it leans far into the green with notes of jalapeño bell pepper and herbs backed by chalky tannins
6750,the cool 2011 vintage has kept this bottling from being as ripe as previous wines from this producer its certainly leaner but for all that its dry silky and elegantly complex in its own way with dried raspberry tea and white pepper flavors it could surprise after 2017
6751,the cool climate of the northern salinas valley enabled the grapes to hang long into the harvest while maintaining bright acidity the result is a lovely riesling offdry and refreshing in the manner of a fine german wine it was blended with a splash of muscat the flavors of green apples peaches tangerines and honeysuckle are clean and vibrant the residual sugar is 142
6752,the cool conditions that defined the 2011 vintage in chile are draped all over this chardonnay the nose deals notes of applesauce and oaky cinnamon while the palate is sleepy with very little happening flavors of spicy oak rest on top of white fruit flavors and the finish is neutral and acidic
6753,the cool vintage took its toll on this unbalanced wine despite enormously high alcohol of 156 it smells vegetal and tastes thin in cherries and asparagus
6754,the corbans house style seems to deemphasizes the ultrapungent elements of sauvignon blanc focusing instead on grapefruit and in this case white nectarine its a delicate wine that goes down easy
6755,the core fruit flavor is pretty strawberry with a root beer aspect often found in oregon pinots there is a bit of an empty spot in the center then a finish with light tannins and a dash of pepper
6756,the crispest aligoté all grapefruit and bright green fruits the wine is fresh clean and lively there is a final light element of wood
6757,the crown jewel of the winerys icestyle wines its gorgeously aromatic with notes of tropical mango and pineapple adorned with honey and blossoms dripping with nectar and yellow peach preserves its lusciously sweet yet impeccably balanced with acidity and an elegant mineral tone that lingers on the finish
6758,the current alphonse mellot is the 19th to bear the name always passed in the family from father to son made from 80yearold vines aged on the lees before bottling the wine has a fine concentration giving generosity a hint of yeastiness spice pink grapefruit and even a final burst of opulence
6759,the curve on this wine has been going up and up and this 09 is their best yet its bone dry and savory in acids with ultraclean citrus mineral and white flower flavors just delicious as a cocktail sipper
6760,the cuvelier family of léovillepoyferré owns this property the wine shows in the dense ripe fruit with dusty tannins and concentration the fruit is generous but it has good dry tannins to give it shape as well as depth of flavor a wine to age 1012 years but certainly drinkable sooner
6761,the côa valley is at the remote eastern end of the douro the wine revels in its firm mineral structured character with acidity spice and a dry center there is weight richness and the potential for aging
6762,the damilano is a modern take on barbera a big very ripe chunky wine that is easy to like the fruit is thick with dark jammy flavors and although there are hints of something more exotic lurking at the moment all you have is a hint of spice easy to drink now but worth cellaring for a couple of years as it will prove to be more interesting with some bottle age
6763,the dead arm rarely wows this reviewer in our blind tastings and while the 2007 is undeniably a very good wine it shows a tart edge and a reinedin personality toast and vanilla frame cranberry and raspberry fruit chocolate overtones and savory meaty elements try it after 2015 and see if it has loosened up at all
6764,the deep gold color here suggests age as do the soft vaguely oxidized flavors still it shows some nice vanilla and baked apple notes as well as slight chalk accents on its toasty oak frame drink now
6765,the deft oaking of this wine has left only the imprint of toasted almonds layered across the top of this richly textured citrusy wine the end result isnt that dissimilar from lemon brioche but an exceedingly fine and elegant version that finishes dry and clean drink now and over the next few years
6766,the doyenne métier generally drinks very well right out of the chute and this 2009 is no exception supple and concentrated this blend of 51 grenache 32 mourvèdre and 17 syrah is an absolute riot of mixed berry fruit scents and flavors full lush dense and quite long in the finish its a spicy brilliant bit of winemaking can it age undoubtedly but good luck keeping your hands off it
6767,the draw for cristalino has always been its crispness but this bottling seems more thick and savory with hamlike aromas and bulky lemon orange and pineapple flavors when this used to be 6 and simple we were all over it but this is soft and tastes like the fruit you get at a buffet breakfast
6768,the drought intensity of the 2007 vintage has left a strong mark on roman bratasiuks entire lineup the 2007 brookman shows great intensity and powerful tar blueberry coffee and black olive aromas and flavors given this wines concentration it should last through 2020 perhaps longer
6769,the dry tannins are firmly in charge in this young wine its fruit fresh rather than rich the flavors are red plum juice acidity and a dry core that needs another year to soften
6770,the dryness hits you first then the tannins this is a syrah thats hard and astringent almost aggressive but then the core of blackberries and cherries kicks in turning spicy and licoricelike on the finish suddenly the wine is interesting one to watch if the winemaker can manage those bigtime tannins
6771,the dsm sparklers all come in a fancy package all are méthode champenoise all finished with a wire cage and champagne cork this is quite yeasty with a pretty toasted coconut flavor that spices up the fruit primarily chardonnay it has no perceptible residual sugar

6773,the easytofind gnarly head a blend of 50 zinfandel 20 merlot 15 cabernet sauvignon 10 petite sirah and 3 syrah is young and ready to drinkits fruity nose and peppery spice tmakes it a fullblown crowd pleaser ready for backyard barbecues
6774,the emphasis here is on elegance not power or intensity the wine offers carefully measured notes of applenut cherry vanilla mineral dried lavender and no clear aromatic protagonist the wines age is discernable in the mouth and this suggests that you should not wait to drink it
6775,the entry starts off a bit green with notes of grass green plum and a touch of pepper the mouthfeel is light and lean but offers loads of fresh citrus flavors by way of tart orange supremes and lime rind the bracing finish and prickly texture make this an easydrinking choice
6776,the entrylevel chardonnay from kumeu river gives just a taste of what heights its chardonnays can achieve with only one third aged in oak the wine comes across as rather fruity and direct with pleasant pear pineapple and melon flavors and a round easygoing style
6777,the entrylevel wine from sacha lichines château desclans it is soft broad with more caramel and spice than fruit it is definitely a food not an apéritif wine

6927,the nose of this vineyarddesignate wine made from partially dried grapes is slightly oakdriven with aromas of spice and vanilla backed by black fruit preserves and mature berry it would pair well with roasted meats or aged cheeses
6928,the nose of this wine is somewhat reduced signalling that it needs to breathe the palate is zesty and comes with a wonderfully grippy but taut phenolic texture lending structure to its slim body of green and yellow apple fruit with riper notions of yellow plum and peach the finish is clean dry and refreshing
6929,the nose offers berry and black plum aromas that come across clean and proper the palate is lush juicy and good in feel with thicker more ripe flavors of warm plum and blackberry reaches almost dessertlevel sweetness on the finish cementing its status as a rich and ripe malbec with moderate structure
6930,the nose offers plenty of cooked plum preserves warm spice and toasted nutty oak theres a nice lush texture and body and bright red cherry and plums flavors on the palate the fruit flavors may be slightly lacking in concentration but supple tannins make for smooth easy sipping
6931,the nose on this appellation blend is kind of sour with gravel blackberry and blueberry the palate is also a bit sour and bitter with beet juice juniper and eucalyptus notes
6932,the nose on this blend of grenache carignan and other grapes burns and smells of iodine mushroom olive and rustic berry fruits high acidity and an obtuse mouthfeel house salty briny minerally plum flavors while the finish runs low on fruit
6933,the nose on this choppy cabernet deals redfruit tomato and pepperonilike aromas the palate is full of life and tight acidity while the flavor profile is gritty and includes baked plum and saltiness a bbqd oaky finish carries plenty of the wines racy acidity leaving mild tartness
6934,the nose on this heavily oaked extremely ripe malbec is minty and stuffed with raisiny notes along with woodbased chocolate and vanilla scents the palate rests on a beam of acidity but overall this is very thick and dense with prune molasses mint and an abundance of oak influence on the finish the barrel element is omnipresent

6938,the nose on this shiraz starts with black pepper black fruit raspberry and chocolate leading into flavors of black fruit smoke and spice fruitforward but with a firm structure the wine will benefit from aging enjoy with heartier meat dishes
6939,the nose powers with wood and high toast aromas but the palate reveals sufficient ripe pineapple and yellow fruit flavors to act as a balance there is a prominent acidity that cuts through this richness the wine certainly needs 34 years for the wood to soften and integrate better with the fruit but then this will be a superb wine imported by robert kacher imports
6940,the nose shows dried blackcherry fruit with tobacco and a playdohlike note light to mediumweight the mouth offers more dried cherries some chocolate and then a hint of tarragon on the finish
6941,the nose suggests a mix of herb citrus and cotton candy in the mouth you find the same odd confluence of flavors maybe all this will come together at some point in time but right now its disjointed and offputting
6942,the notes of peach and flowers are light and contrast with the palates weight and oily feel its enjoyable but an alcoholic burn on the finish distracts
6943,the oak barrel influence comes across quite strong in this chardonnay the wine itself made from fruit sourced from this mountain appellation in the central part of sonoma county is rich in tropical fruit and pear flavors with zesty acidity
6944,the oak influence has been trimmed back at jaboulet in recent vintages and this wine shows only traces of menthol and cedar cracked peppercorns and red cherries form the core aromas and flavors of this mediumbodied but long and mouthwatering wine approachable now but it should age well for at least 10 years
6945,the oak stands out on this young fruity wine giving a buttered toast and caramelized aroma and flavor to the underlying blackberry and black currant flavors its thoroughly dry and a little aggressive in tannins give it a year or two but it doesnt seem like an ager
6946,the oakinfluenced nose is an aromatic showcase of honeyed nut granny smith apple dried caramel and flower petal soft and weighty upon entrance the palate picks up some acidic steam on the midpalate finishing with a mediumtolong flavor of toasty warm spiced apple
6947,the olazabalferreira family owns two douro quintas this and vale meão high upriver vallado is in a cooler wetter climate and produces elegant wines in a modern smooth style based on one of the lesser port grapes the sousão this is full of black currant fruits and new wood flavors
6948,the old vines here do give some concentration more importantly they give a great swathe of ripe fruit that is so crisp and refreshing lemon and the lightest texture are lifted by intense acidity and a lively fresh aftertaste this wine is ready to drink
6949,the old vines on the steep slopes of the heiligenstein vineyard give one of austrias greatest wines this is one of those rieslings that will last indefinitely a powerful concentrated blend of white fruits perfumes peaches very tight and closed now racy acidity and minerality shoot through the richness give this 10 years at least
6950,the only fieldblended wine to actually call itself a field blend consists of zinfandel petite sirah and carignan its very dry and bold in tannins a rather earthy wine with a deep core of fruit should age effortlessly for decades
6951,the only sweetness on offer is on the nose after that things go lightweight and tangy leaving a racy feel and semiastringent cherry flavors a real sizzler with zesty red fruit and not much else
6952,the opening aromas entail peach pear and some light oakjust what youd hope for from a chilean chardonnay since only part of the wine was barrel aged the body holds onto some snap and clarity still some vanilla and lees character create richness and ultimately a good wine
6953,the opening of peach mineral honey and wild green herbs is alluring and the palate runs smooth and full and also a little soft and mature banana papaya and melon flavors are pretty and the finish holds its stature not as minerally and tight as some this wine has sweetness and depth drink soon
6954,the opening runs a bit sour tomatoey and stemmy while the palate offers darkness and weight along with savory herbal flavors that come across earthy and burnt tastes as much like tomato paste and herbs as it does berry fruit drink now or let it pass
6955,the opening scent of funky sweaty leather is not promising and indeed it tastes overly soft and muted you can sense some good fruit in there but its tamped down the tannins stick out making the wine awkward and common
6956,the optu red is 55 cabernet sauvignon 30 merlot 9 malbec and 6 petit verdot no cab franc which seems to be losing favor among washington winemakers the 2007 is a much better optu than its predecessor nicely structured and balanced with a blend of fruit leaf earth and barrel that is seamless and complex elegant and detailed this is a wine to tuck away for a few years
6957,the opulence of this sparkling wine has to be tasted to be believed its far softer and silkier than the winerys companion new release the 2005 j schram but then the blend is the complete opposite this ones mainly pinot noir with the balance from chardonnay the pinot noir brings a warm raspberry and cherrysauce richness to chardonnays limes and pears while an extraordinarily delicious toastiness pervades the whole as if it had been gently smoked so enticing now its hard to keep from drinking the whole bottle and you certainly can but this is a wine that will age for 1015 years
6958,the other blends 65 chardonnay with 25 sauvignon blanc and 10 viognier the result is a fullbodied oakinfluenced white offering fig vanilla custard and honey amidst a sweet core that threatens to overwhelm
6959,the overt ripeness of the fruit here presents a slight obstacle at first sniff once that is overcome the wine offers a free range of blackberry cassis tar leather and tobaccolike aromas but in the mouth youll taste the jamminess and maturity of the fruit its a smooth soft wine with a long strawberry fade
6960,the overwhelming impression is of strong astringently dry tannins that absolutely limit pleasure is it worth cellaring theres a deep core of black cherry and cassis fruit and adequate acidity the wine will undoubtedly throw sediment and soften but that doesnt equate to improvement your best bet is to decant and drink with rich fatty meats and cheeses
6961,the owners a branch of the fetzers make a big deal about being biodynamic and the wine does seem to have a laserlike purity of citrus zest and grapefruit sorbet flavor thats so clean and vibrant the tech notes say there was some new oak but you can hardly sense it since the fruit and acidity are so upfront
6962,the packaging is amusing the wine is 100 cabernet sauvignon and its quite a nice refreshing sipper drinks totally dry and crisp in acids with rosehip tea and black cherry flavors that finish long and spicy
6963,the packaging is totally crazy but the wine is more subdued a blend of syrah merlot and cabernet it delivers raw strawberry green leaf notes and loads of dried hay it has a sharp solid build and rigid tannins
6964,the palate has a touch of green rosemary and wild berry with a hint of toasted almond on the finish it is named after the highaltitude vineyard located 13001700 feet above sea level from which the nero davola grapes were sourced
6965,the palmes dor rosé is always distinctive not always for the good however this 2003 vintage shows well with ripe cherry flavors yeast and a soft open texture the acidity adds a crisp lemon zest aftertaste
6966,the patina vineyard has some of the oldest syrah plantings in the walla walla valley and this designate is a fine effort the dryfarmed grapes yield mixed flavors of raspberry boysenberry and cherry with hints of tobacco leaf licorice streaks through the finish which lingers with excellent concentration
6967,the pauly bergweiler style leans toward ripe and sweet but this bottling also shows plenty of acidity honeyed orange and pineapple flavors are concentrated and rich balanced by hints of petrol slate and peppery spice
6968,the pedigree of this syrah is topnotch the vineyard was planted by one of the owners of the fine cabernet house surh luchtel and one of the winerys coowners works at the von strasser winery the wine itself shows promise but is a little too ripe and sweet for comfort with jammy stewed blackberry cherry and cola flavors that have been welloaked
6969,the perfumes of wood mingle with sweet malbec berry fruit aromas the wine is in a style that initially emphasizes the fresh juicy fruit then it moves in on the tannins to give a densely dry wine finishing with a tight mineral edge
6970,the pertinace evolved nicely in the glass at first there are simple lime peel aromas but over time they become richer and slightly more complex on the palate there is pear as well as the lime and an interesting smoky quality crisp and with good balance the finish is a little short imported by mw imports
6971,the philosophy here is to rely on bottle age to bring the acids into balance rather than doing a lot of malolactic fermentation the current release is this 97 when most producers are onto the 99s despite only 15 malo theres a creamy richness to this wine in the mouth to go with delicate toast and bold pineapple flavors that pick up anise and black pepper notes on the finish
6972,the pineapple and lemon aromas and flavors in this wine just seem to lack the spark to make them come alive theres a medium texture on the palate but the subdued uninspired quality extends to the mouthfeel as well a reserve label deserves more substance
6973,the poets leap riesling continues its string of outstanding vintages once again exceptionally concentrated and complex the highacid 2008 vintage adds extra juicy vibrancy to the fruit giving the wine an impression of dryness though it is a bit over 1 residual sugar and a dense layered fruit component a mix of old vine and german clones this is a superb effort
6974,the prestigious osoyoos larose project just released pétalesits second wineblended from barrels that were given the same firstclass treatment as le grand vin organic earthy leafy flavors infuse the dark smoky fruit at half the cost of its big brother pétales is also more accessible and offers much the same challenging complexity
6975,the price isnt bad on this soft sweet nonvintage blend it has candied flavors of berries cherries and cola
6976,the primary flavors are of limelime pith and white peach which hang on a clean frame fresh green accents are pleasant but not for everyone
6977,the principal difference between blanquette and cremant de limoux is in the proportion of mauzac which has to be in the blendmore for the blanquette which is why this wine has 90 mauzac more spice than fruit and finishes with flavors of grilled almonds
6978,the problem here is a lack of fruit except for a hint of chardonnay peaches and cream you get little beyond alcohol and acidity but its a clean wine
6979,the problem is the high 162 alcohol that makes the wine hot porty and sweet
6980,the problem with this special cuvée from mongravey is wood there is too much of it and it completely dominates the highextract fruit there is toast oak and more toast the fruit seems too light to cope
6981,the problem with this wine is its too sweet and hot it goes beyond rich ripe fruit into frankly jellied flavors of blackberries cherries and vanilla with a porty finish the alcohol is 154
6982,the producer claims this is the first vermentino in the world to be aged in barrique indeed this is a spectacular lateharvest wine not sweet though with full and generous tones of apricot and honey this is a big and bold white wine that can still use another few years of cellar aging
6983,the production of malbec at three rivers has risen dramatically and the new vintage seems considerably lighter and less complex than it previously did fruity and forward it shows black cherry and cola flavors with a light streak of licorice
6984,the purest riesling flavors are to be found in this great wine at this stage it is still very tight and closed up but there is so much leashed power there along with complex hints of fruits minerals and exotic perfumes give it at least five years and it will begin to slowly evolve
6985,the quality and persistency of the fruit is impressive this riserva barolo is extremely generous in terms of its cherry blackberry cola and exotic spice aromas the wine sports fine texture and smooth flavors of plum and leather on the close
6986,the quarts de chaume the four fingers of land that rise above the layon valley are one of the pinnacles of sweet wines in the loire showing botrytis and layers of dryness over the honey and peach jelly flavors but also has great freshness the aftertaste just lasts
6987,the quinta da leda is high up the douro in the remote regions of douro superior this 2004 shows the concentration of the fruit in the dark tannins the toasty new wood and the ripe dark plum fruits it is smooth enough to drink now but the tannins promise 56 years aging
6988,the quiot familys château du trignon is located in gigondas but has holdings in several nearby villages the 2007 rasteau is rather fruit driven cherries and plums but manages to fold in hints of chocolate anise and french roast supple on the finish drink now2015
6989,the quié family owners of crozetbages in pauillac and rauzangassies in margaux live in this northern hautmédoc property the 2010 is closed firmly tannic and solidly structured it feels chunky and its black plum flavor is tightly packed
6990,the raspberryinflected nose shows some farm aromas of manure and horse sweat theres mixed berry nose in the mouth and no tannin to speak of while the short ashy finish has a slightly disjointed note of acidity drink up
6991,the red cherry cola and spice flavors finish a little onedimensional but the mouthfeel is light and silky on this pleasant pinot noir with tart acidity it needs fatty meats like lamb or steak to balance it
6992,the red that helped build the house of gallo never really went away theres a little pinot noir here mixed with zinfandel sangiovese syrah and a couple of others its what its always been dry balanced and totally easy with some real fullbodied richness
6993,the relatively unknown côte de léchet vineyard is on the southern bank of the serein river which gives it a cool exposure the result in 2006 is a wine that is light delicate floating on fresh green fruits and honeyed toast it needs food with its crisp fine finish
6994,the reserve cab from jones spent 18 months in new french and american oak and the resulting wine is big liquorous and astringent layers of smoke espresso vanilla bean and tobacco wrap around a core of cassis this is dark pure and potent
6995,the reserve merlot lacks the smooth buttery softness of the regular bottling substituting stiffer tannins deeper color and a definite herbal component perhaps the thinking is that this will age longer but for sheer pleasure it does not measure up to its less expensive sibling
6996,the reserve wine from lamothecissac is now a wine that is well on the way to maturity it has a leathery texture thats well integrated with wood and mushroom flavors the acidity is just in the background drink now or over the next 34 years
6997,the restrained nose shows a faint floral character accompanied by notes of lemon cream and mineral the palate hesitantly opens up a bit more with flavors of peach skin lemon icebox pie and whipping cream decidedly medium in weight this has mediumconcentrated fruit and a rather linear palate the moderate refreshing acidity leads to a fairly short finish drink this now and for two years as it should be appreciated while still youthful
6998,the restrained nose shows some white peach notes lees and stony minerality this is complex layered and persistent across the palate opening up to ample stone fruit flavors earthy notes dried herbs and spice crisp with sweetness moderately concentrated flavors and a rich texture all in balance if a little loose knit on the finish
6999,the restrained perfume of white muscat grapes dances on nose and slimline palate this is a lightweight perfumed but subtle apéritif that would also work alongside freshly cut tropical fruit a summer wine if ever there were one
7000,the rich bouquet shows buttery creamy vanilla notes with hints of tarragon and sweet hay golden apple and pear wears sweet butterscotch on the mediumweight soft palate shows a bit of alcoholic heat as well as good intensity and impressive weight but a one taster found it too controlled by vanillin oak qualities at the expense of the fruit
7001,the richest wine in the pellé range full of superripe fruits with great maturity the wine concentrates on mango and pineapple along with some fine linear citrus acidity worth aging for 12 years
7002,the rieflé style of pinot gris is to emphasize the ripe apricot flavors this wine does that but adds an extra complexity with its smoky aromas and its dense spice and tropical fruit character it isnt sweet but it is certainly rich
7003,the right sense of weight and structure are allied with gorgeous fruitiness and freshness this winning combination shows black fruits and a brooding character that needs time drink from 2018
7004,the rigorously en famille anselma estate offers a bold and innovative interpretation of barolo with loads of red fruit cola and exotic spice despite its big aromatic personality the wine is subdued and elegant in the mouth with silky smoothness and a long mineraldriven finish
7005,the ripe dramatic flavors of blackberry and cherry seem like theyre right out of the jam jar and they meld with toasty oak and crisp coastalinspired acidity this needs some time in the bottle to knit together so give it 56 years
7006,the ripe lean smooth fruit is complemented by tobacco and cedar accents has a refined feel and classic tartness to the cherry flavors tight now the full tannins on the finish can use a year or two to resolve but handsome tar and licorice accents already show and the solid components will knit themselves together well with a little time
7007,the saint clair style usually features prominent herbaceous notes but this special block bottling tones down that influence instead relying more on melon fig and mineral notes for impact its fullbodied broad and mouthfilling in the context of sauvignon blanc with a long white grapefruit finish drink through the end of 2008
7008,the sandgrube vineyard is one of the larger vineyards in the krems area well exposed to the danube river this grüner is soft finely formed with a youthful texture that gives a mineral tang keep this wine for a year screwcap
7009,the second vintage of this wine comes from a great douro year it gives structure dark fruits and a serious tannic structure that has been rounded by wood aging spice berries and mint flavors all contribute to this powerful ageworthy wine drink from 2017
7010,the second wine from château vignelaure a vast estate near aixenprovence this is a textured ripe wine it has red fruits but also a great tang of orange and lemon zest that gives it a delicious refreshing lift
7011,the second wine of château pichonlongueville is soft perfumed and delicious its a wine with plenty of juicy fruit though at this stage the wood is too dominant the finish shows a hint of spice
7012,the sequeira vineyard in the upper reaches of douro superior obviously can produce powerful rich wines but this ripeness is held in check by the dark structure and the firm tannins this reserva needs time to smooth out the solid structure
7013,the shea is the most dense and concentrated wine among the 2004s jammed with blackberry cherry plum licorice and earthy tannins great concentration and a smoky blacktea finish this is one to tuck away for a few years
7014,the simple structure frames cherry red currant and sandalwood flavors at this price though its a useful everyday wine
7015,the slightly oxidized nose of this wine by michael gill recalls dried yet tart apricot skins with a bit of white peach freshness the palate is framed by acidity while offering apple and lime flavors
7016,the smoked meat and spice on the nose of this consistently good cabernet give it an exotic south african appeal but the wine goes beyond merely unique balanced tannins and good acidity give this poise and dimension its smoke and berry layers soft and approachable a very nice wine at a good price
7017,the smooth citrusscented nose that opens this wine shows an interesting faint candlewaxlike note vivid focused fruit followskiwi and green berries dominatewith bracing acids and a crisp slatey bottom fine balance keeps it light and lively despite the ripe fruit and it extends into a clean finish of medium length
7018,the soft fruitiness of this blend makes it ideal for sipping now with ham broiled chicken or casual picnic fare its not a complicated wine to ponder over but to enjoy for its savory raspberry jam vanilla and cinnamon flavors
7019,the soft spicy scents of the bouquet mix grapes flowers talcum powder and a faint petrol note to create an almost gewürzlike symphony its lovely and impressively complex as layers of grape flavor flowers minerals and citrus rind gain power in the mouth the mineral elements come up on the tangy finish exotic and smooth it is immediately appealing but also built to age for 68 years
7020,the softness and rusticity that almost always mark sierra foothills wines are here yet the wine rises to what might be called coastal elegance a spanifornia blend of tempranillo and cab sauvignon it has a complexity that unfolds in waves of blackberry tobacco clove anise and espresso drink now
7021,the softness of the 2009 vintage is very apparent in this wine it is rounded with pear and ripe apple flavors a touch of toast and a gentle lemon zest aftertaste ready to drink
7022,the spare red fruit seems set in stone the avas characteristic subflavors of concrete and dry stone are on full display the wine remains tightly wound with crisp definition this should benefit from another couple of years in bottle it finishes with plenty of acid and chalk
7023,the sparkling delicate minerality and snappy fruit flavors for which elgin is known come into full force here with a balance of acid and puckering fruit offering a clean quaff it could use a touch more roundness but overall has a graceful character that distinguishes it from other overwrought new world sauvignons
7024,the star of the show among the three libra wines tasted this biodynamicallyfarmed offering is dark and exotic with a range of scents from cherry liqueur to cinnamon anise and flowers it breathes open into a perfumed and spicy wine with accents of orange peel around substantial brambly fruit
7025,the starmont designation is sort of a junior version of merryvales more expensive wines and is often a solid value so it is with this cab whose grapes come from some prestigious vineyards its dry rich and complex with a classic napa balance of firm sweet tannins acidity and cassis and cherry fruit beautiful now and should hold well for six years
7026,the steep stony slope of the cul de beaujeu has produced this firmly structured wine that has rich plum and berry fruits it is an impressive wine ripe and juicy with plenty of youthful crisp freshness the wine needs to age to plumb the depths that are there for the future drink from 2018
7027,the stiftsbreite vineyard has a claim to fame it is the largest st laurent vineyard in the world this fruity wine sums up the grape with ripe red berry and spicy black cherry flavors just bursting with juice and bright acidity
7028,the strong toastedoak aromas ride heavy over melon and pear fruit but this wine manages to keep it together turning almost elegant on the finish where the oak is reflected in a long menthol echo
7029,the style at domaines ott has changed to become fresher and less oxidative and the wine fits the new look it is vivid crisp a rich texture giving fresh berry fruit and a light layer of acidity
7030,the sundance is always a fine value forward and loaded with spicy strawberry cranberry and raspberry fruit theres excellent detail in the way the fruits are intertwined and a kiss of chocolaty oak in the soft sweet finish
7031,the tannins and the acids dominate this dry fruity wine locking it down and making it harshly astringent its hard to imagine drinking it with anything except the richest beef because it would overwhelm more delicate dishes
7032,the tannins are hard and strong its not undrinkable but it is hard to enjoy despite a solid core of black currants and cassis liqueur the finish is bone dry and astringent drink now
7033,the tannins are so rich and the acidity so fine that this zin gets extra points its fantastically ripe in flavors with a spectrum of red and black cherries cassis black raspberries anisette tangerines cocoa and dusty spices delicious
7034,the tannins are strong and the blackberry currant and oak flavors have an earthy herbaceous tug instead of flamboyance it shows precision and control but those tannins make it too astringent to enjoy now it will age easily until 2020 2024 is not a stretch another ten years is but you never know with a wine this dry and balanced
7035,the tapteil vineyard designate is 53 cabernet sauvignon 15 cab franc and 32 merlot from vines that are now 20 years old with each new vintage the wine seems to gain in detail as a result tapteil fruit is distinguished by a distinctive dustiness and sports an elegant structure whoselightness belies its power with its spicy acidic berry flavors and hints of smoke and leather this has an italian personality as well
7036,the tart cherry and earth flavors here have a green haylike note around the edges its a touch light but the fruit is decent and its not buried under massive doses of oak the mediumlength finish has modest tannins drink now
7037,the tempranillo has an agreeable entry with pretty violet scents leading into tart raspberry and cherry fruit amplified with a bit of barrel spice it loses steam quickly and the tannins turn chewy and a bit rough but more bottle age may help smooth it out
7038,the terse nature of assyrtico finds a friend in oak when properly administered as this wine exhibits on the nose citrus and mineral harmoniously mingle with spice and toast on the palate the wine retains its bright lemon and citrus flavors but is given extra body through the subtle oak a lovely wine with a clean finish
7039,the texture of this pinot blanc is chardonnaylike but the flavors veer more toward tangerines and oranges with a buttered toast honey and vanilla richness its a rich creamy complicated wine a little sweet and soft but a good partner with complex lobster shrimp and scallop dishes
7040,the textures a little rough in this fruity wine but its fine to drink now with burgers barbecue or mexican blended from zinfandel petite sirah and mourvèdre thats grown in the delta and the sierra foothills it has blackberry and blueberry flavors
7041,the textures all wrong on this wine because the ripeness levels and tannins are unbalanced the cherry and wood flavors have streaks of green and jalapeño pepper and theres some funkiness
7042,the theme here is dryness with dried apricot pressed rose petal banana dried herbs tealeaf and pungent toasted and smoky tones together this medley of aromas is delicate and caressing on the nose and equally tender in the mouth imported by dalla terra
7043,the thick moist skin of a fresh orange is the single most recognizable element of this wines sweet nose honey almond and lemon zest also make an appearance adding extra layers of complexity thanks to its chewy mouthfeel and good length this late harvest moscadello would make an excellent companion to an orange or lemon based dessert dish
7044,the thick oily texture is backed by aroflavors of stone fruit honeysuckle and passion fruit this is a generous and bold wine
7045,the third and most impressive wine in a series of singlevineyard wines from the 900foot plateau above the lot river this is a wine to age very mineral in character and very structured with tight tannins keep for six years and more
7046,the top cuvée from mas del périé this is a concentrated wine with new wood and black fruit notes its packed with intense tannins spice from the wood aging and a great depth of flavor this is an impressive wine that will need to age for at least 56 years
7047,the top cuvée from roubine this unusual blend of tibouren and clairette is intensely perfumed and ripe and with a fine stylish character it is an impressive wine with yellow fruits as well as red currant and citrus this food friendly wine should age a bit so drink from late 2017
7048,the toughness of this wine works in its favor giving it a chewy mouthfeel that balances and grounds the sweet currant cassis and licorice flavors notes of black pepper tobacco and herbs add to this impression of earthiness its a lovely wine and fully drinkable now
7049,the two ramospinto quintas of ervamoira and bons ares provide contrasting fruitthe hot dry conditions of ervamoira and the more temperate climate of bons ares together with this coffee and oak flavored wine built upon ripe fruits they make an impressive combination of dark spicy flavors
7050,the underlying wine shows real santa barbara chard character of crispness and ripe juicy fruit with flavors of pineapples and peaches but a huge major flaw is excessive oakiness all that caramel and butterscotch throws this otherwise likeable wine out of balance
7051,the unique combination of chocolate and spice in the aromas of this wine calls to mind chocolate teddy grahams but its by no means a kiddie wine its fullbodied and soft with flavors of tobacco earth and spice and a smoky coffeelike note on the finish a blend of zweigelt blaüfrankisch and merlot imported by winemonger
7052,the val di cornia suvereto appellation may not be recognized much abroad or even in italy but it is definitely worth keeping an eye on this blend of cabernet sauvignon merlot and sangiovese is rich soft and medium in intensity and it offers great balance between the red fruit and dark spice components
7053,the valley is todays modern silicon valley but used to be one of the most famous placenames in california wine this syrah is dry and classy with a côtesdurhône berried deliciousness and a soft immediate appeal
7054,the valois reserve makes its debut with this 2005 bottling it is a blend of the winerys five best barrels and was given the allstar treatment its still pulling itself together somewhat muddy in color with a soft plummy nose of primary fruits a strongly acidic component left a chalky impression in the mouth further suggesting that this needs more time to integrate
7055,the value label from condes de albarei is always a good bet oceanic aromas and a spritz of lime make the nose just right and the lively palate of lemon melon and banana is charged up tight on the finish with citrus and almond skins and then a lasting impression of pineapple young and raring to go

7268,theres an unripe green edge to this zinfandel that detracts from its appeal yet it has some good blackberry fruit and its nicely dry and tannic pair this with rich meats and cheeses to coax out the sweetness
7269,theres an unripe vegetal taste that detracts from the wines otherwise fine qualities its dry and crisp and minerally with pineapple fruit but that asparagus edge is annoying
7270,theres been an evolution taking place at this house with new oak no longer ubiquitous in the offerings in fact this wine is aged solely in concrete which allows charming hints of lavender and thyme to shine among the cherry and cocoa notes its fullbodied yet firm so pair it with burgers or steaks off the grill
7271,theres cherry and licorice on the nose of this crisp lighterstyle wine bright tart fruit and cocoa accents follow on the palate and its bright and moderately tannic on the finish a good pizzapasta partner this will even out over the next 12 months and drink well through 2004
7272,theres compelling balance between the baked red cherry fruit graphitelike minerality and brown spice on the nose of this bottling further enhanced by leather and earth aromas bright raspberry meets with cooked strawberry and licorice flavors on the palate where a somewhat frothy texture is powered by acidity atop soft yet somewhat structuring tannins
7273,theres enormously ripe pure fruit in this pinot it floods the palate with red cherry pie cola root beer and spice flavors that are undeniably delicious yet the wine is too soft and jammily extracted to be balanced
7274,theres enough unripe fruity flavor in this wine to detract from its pleasure as dry crisp and silky as it is its cherry and cola flavors are marred by a sharp green taste of menthol

7279,theres loads of spice on the nose followed by dried currant berry blueberry tart cinnamon and tobacco the wine delivers a fresh and elegant component that fuels a long sensation on the finish its not too thick or dense which also plays in its favor imported by enotec imports inc
7280,theres lots of brisk acidity in this bonedry pinot which gives it a mouthwatering tartness coupled with raspberry and cherry fruit it has a sour candy taste which is relieved by smoky oak its light bodied but it maintains a certain elegance try it with tuna tartare

7283,theres lots of spicy richness in this slightly sweet sauvignon blanc with zesty acidity its flavors veer toward pineapples limes melons and vanilla this should be versatile with all kinds of foods
7284,theres lots of stimulating acidity in this wine which is mostly from the valdiguie grape otherwise known as napa gamay it shows good cherry and spice flavors and is on the dry side making it a good palate cleaner great with sushi
7285,theres more good to this rough and rugged varietal than there is bad its hugely fruity perfectly ripe colorful and full of cola coffee black fruit rubber and length itll definitely last in a cellar and that can only help soften the punishing tannins and mouthfeel that dominate the current state
7286,theres more rhubarb and bramble here than we prefer from a young everyday malbec and thus the bouquet is austere and only skin deep as might be expected given the aromas the palate is limited to herbal lightly pickled red fruit while the finish is quick and offers some lasting chocolate decent wine but thats as far as it goes
7287,theres more than enough to like about this redfruit driven middleweight its sure handed and fruity with enough grip balance and character that it doesnt sway from that baselevel quality line
7288,theres no escaping the wines funky leathery aromas that settle on moss and earth familiar plum and berry flavors have a touch of stem in the mix while the finish is full medicinal and anchored by mildly bitter tannins not bad but tastes and feels a little roasted and rough
7289,theres no merlot in california thats richer or more decadent than this the flavors of cherry pie filling cassis red currants chocolate licorice and smoky oak are totally delicious granted the wine is a little soft with a melted texture and classicists will complain its made in the international style theyre missing out on a real hedonistic pleasure
7290,theres no mistaking the high sweet spice character of the traminer grape in this crisp fresh aperitifstyle wine while the acidity is low there is freshness from mandarin orange and lychee flavors screwcap
7291,theres no oak on this wine but it sure doesnt lack in richness offers a blast of lemons limes pineapples honeysuckle flowers vanilla and smoky butter brightened with crisp acidity the grapes come from yountville
7292,theres no oak on this wine but it was aged on the lees which gives a yeastiness to the sweet orange pineapple lime green apple and vanilla flavors crisp acidity provides clean balance nice now as a cocktail sipper
7293,theres no shortage of ripe aromas leather berries and aged cheese yet the palate is quite sharp with searing acidity sitting on top of redberry flavors this wine has unlimited aging potential but will it ever taste great that remains to be seen
7294,theres not a ton of intensity to the bouquet of this wine but some serious sniffing can coax out suggestions of red apple and white florals the mouth offers a bit more by way of full juicy cantaloupe and grapefruit supreme flavors fresh and easy drink now
7295,theres not much chardonnay grown on howell mountain but heres one to check out it has an unusually pungent earthiness leading to rich flavors of yellow apricots lemon tart and kumquats with a complex touch of mushroom bone dry and crisp it should develop bottle complexities over the next 56 years
7296,theres not much difference between this wine and the labels less expensive brandal this is a bit richer with chunky melon aromas and peach melba flavors but it may suffer a bit from additional ripeness and lower acidity for best results get at it fast
7297,theres not much pulp or grit here but this easygoing and wellpriced chardonnay does offer distant aromas of stone fruit and honey citrus flavors and sharp acidity best describe the mouthfeel
7298,theres nothing not to like about this wine with its generous aromas of cherry fruit plum forest berry spice and roasted chestnut smooth and caressing the wine is easy to drink but could also be considered for a pairing with more elaborate meat dishes
7299,theres oak galore in this mediumweight applefruited piedmont wine the palate is slightly tart with tangy oak splayed over a granny smith greenapple base finishes with decent length but again propelled more by wood than fruit oak lovers will gush over this and will find more to like about it than this reviewer did
7300,theres plenty going on here from the sweet tannins and strawberry flavors to the leathery mature edge the wine is so ripe its structure keeping the generous fruit together but allowing an almost opulent character to dominate
7301,theres plenty of coolclimate character in this vital young syrah its rich in flavors of freshly crushed black pepper blackberry jam and bacon with a smooth velvety mouthfeel its a little light in texture so drink it now with steak
7302,theres plenty of freshly squeezed lemon and apple flavor in this crisp racy wine behind the honey and petrol aromas however theres a slightly industrial rubbery note lingering in the backdrop nice tart acidity finishes with a hint of sour apple candy on the palate
7303,theres plenty of toast for lovers of new oak with cinnamon and mocha giving it an assertive comeon like a vinous frappucino the core fruit is soft and round mixing cherries and plums in with all that toast and chocolate pleasant and smooth best for nearterm drinking
7304,theres quite a bit of green on this nose of this blend of 63 merlot 24 cabernet franc 10 cabernet sauvingnon 2 malbec and 1 petit verdot with grilled jalapeño most prevalent the palate is not very dense though proves dynamic showing red cherries and elderberries laced with green peppercorns
7305,theres residual sugar in this wine to judge by the sweet cherry cola flavors with a hit of alcohol
7306,theres so much nuance and complexity in this rustic yet fascinating croatian wine that it takes a while to break down its components initial scents of dried leaves and mulch blow off to reveal an array of delicate floral and fruit aromas accented by rich chocolate and vanilla notes big in both alcohol and structure its massively tannic but smoothes out with aeration decant to drink now but could easily evolve for 510 years
7307,theres so much nuance to this multifaceted chardonnay sunny tangerine and apple flavors are accented by hints of smoke salted butter and a beautiful crushedstone minerality it is dry and fullbodied with rich texture and sprightly acidity
7308,theres some good fresh citrus character here a pleasant light and easy style of wine hinting at wood with vanilla flavors fresh acidity gives the finish a lift
7309,theres some juicy cassis fruit here accented by hints of chocolate but also some green herbal notes pleasant easydrinking wine but a touch too green to rate higher
7310,theres some richness in this wellmade wine which is showing peach and tropical fruit flavors with vanilla and toast accents finishes a bit astringent calling for rich shellfish
7311,theres something special about this zin given a handful of petite sirah for aromatic depth it opens with supple hightoned raspberry and cherry before delving into a layering of dusty cinnamon spice juicy alive and fresh it delivers a cherryvanilla finish
7312,theres virtually no bouquet to this wine and the palate follows suit with a flat feel and hollow faded flavors of balsamicdoused cherry and herb it seems aged and dried out
7313,these are purchased grapes from kestrel the wine is bright and fresh with crisp aromas of citrus and white peach and flavors that follow there is barely perceptible sweetness more an absence of bitterness in sum this is a perfect patio sipping wine
7314,these are still young vines and showing rather simple though attractive fruit flavors of raspberry strawberry and red currant vague hints of pepper and rock suggest good things to come but for now this is a bit of an underachiever for the price
7315,these old vines were planted in 1973 producing a graceful wine that just hints at more subtle notes under the primary fruit and new oak mixed red berry currant and cherry flavors run into stiff tannins with airing it opens out revealing the brambly wildfruit flavors of old vines and introducing mocha and caramel
7316,they didnt let any malolactic fermentation into this wine a wise decision because you wouldnt want it to be any softer still theres a prettiness to the ripe green apple honey and toast flavors which are complexed with layers of tropical fruits spices and lees
7317,they say the vines are 85 years old and i can believe it because these authentically old zin vines are intense its not just intensity of cherryberry fruit but of substances that seem to exist deep in the soil like stones and minerals and organic matter and decomposing volcanic litter and old compounds washed down from the mountains over time i like this dry tannic complex zinfandel a lot
7318,they say the vines average 80 years of age which means who knows where those old roots have explored for that matter who knows what the grape varieties really are the wine is the least fruity of the winerys current zins while it shows berrycherry and licorice flavors its notable for hardtodescribe earthy mineral and mushroomy tastes that are interesting and unique
7319,thick and almost purple in color this succulent recioto has notes of black cherry bramble dried raspberry and spice the wine has tart sweetness and solid structure and can stand up to chocolate fudge cake because of its cleaning tannins
7320,thick and dense in the mouth with candied flavors of chocolatecovered cherries and new oak this is a delicious wine that could be a little drier and more structured the acidity is low making the wine feel soft and melted
7321,thick and luscious with bursting citrus flavors backed by stone fruit and nectarine this is a perfect choice to pair with fried calamari or onion rings the wine is deliciously thick and creamy in the mouth with lingering fruit
7322,thick and masculine this has savory aromas of pipe tobacco candied fruit leather cola and tar theres soft succulence in the mouth thanks to the ripeness of the fruit but the solid tannins still need time to soften drink after 2018
7323,thick and potent on the nose with aromas of prune cola and fig feels dense and syrupy with dulce de leche cocoa and integrated citrus flavors an unbridled winner with richness length and raw value how many 15 wines rank this high not many
7324,thick black and impenetrable this is one of the most densely extracted wines you will ever encounter despite its extreme size it maintains a fresh delicate character throughout thanks to the obvious quality of the fruit opulent oak and spice tones might be distracting to valpolicella puristsbut make no mistake this is an impressive and exciting wine
7325,thick heavy and jammy now with blackberry cherry and raspberry flavors balanced with good acidity almost rustic in the fruity concentration and tart acids your best bet is the cellar try after 2013
7326,thick impenetrable and darkly concentrated this bold syrah from tuscany awards aromas of spice blueberry and natural rubber the only concern is that those rubbery smells will turn into band aid and animal fur with more time in the bottle dont wait to drink it
7327,thick opulent and sophisticated this ambercolored dessert wine made from sundried zibibbo grapes is probably the best single export from pantelleria a volcanic island between sicily and africa delicate aromas of almond apricot jam honey raisin and maple syrup are vibrant and absolutely irresistible its impossible not to love this wine
7328,thickly soft and ripe this simple wine has stewy flavors of blackberries cherries and leather and shows the strong tannins that usually mark a young petite sirah the wine is fully dry
7329,thickly textured and rather sweet with superripe apples and pears that at times seem almost drenched in honey probably best on its own wellchilled as a hotweather apéritif
7330,thickly textured and sweet with simple fruity flavors of cherries strawberries and watermelon
7331,thierry hamelin has produced this wine specially for the xavier flouret range it is lightly perfumed with whiteflower aromas and has a mineral texture and delicious refreshing citrus flavors full of tangy fruit and acidity at the end it is a wine to drink now
7332,thin and generic this could be any basic white wine its got a splash of sauvignon blanc and gewürztraminer in the blend but falls flat in the mouth with a little celery and green apple flavor quickly fading
7333,thin and tight this highacid syrah is stubbornly closed its difficult to predict whenor ifit will open up right now it doesnt show much beyond acid and stem
7334,thin fruit flavors seem overtaken by the barrel flavors the wine spent nine months in one third new french oaknot excessive by any means but the fruit just isnt up to it at the moment more bottle age may bring up the light apple into more substantial focus
7335,thin green and tannic
7336,thin in fruit with herb mint and cherry flavors that have a porty edge and the lack of substance makes the oak stand out as caramelized an awkward wine
7337,think of this as baby sineann peter rosback made this light and pretty pinot for vineyard owner bob morus its an oregon beaujolais from young vines and using no new oak impeccably fresh and just 13 alcohol it tastes of clean bright strawberry and cherry fruit
7338,thinning but with catchy aromas of leather citrus peel forest floor and cola the palate offers sweeping dried fruits mostly cassis and cherry meanwhile the finish is tight and guarded by mature tannins and vital acidity interestingly root beer and turnip show up at the very end
7339,thirty bucks may seem like a lot for an entrylevel riesling but this is an exemplary example aromas of wet stones moss and spring flowers are mouthwatering and then are followed by a complex array of nonfruity flavors like stones and greens carried along by a mouthfeel thats light as a feather tart pineapple emerges on the long finish drink anytime over the next 10 years
7340,this 07 is a bit tired already with a muted nose offering up subtle hints of strawberry hull and peach fuzz the mouth offers a bit more by way of red currant rhubarb and limey citrus notes the finish though a bit tart is crisp and clean
7341,this 100 cab is one to keep an eye on lush and ripe in cassis carob and herb flavors with a rich tannin and acid structure drink now being careful to decant but better after 2008 and through 2012
7342,this 100 cab shows all the hallmarks of an ageable wine but its beautiful now for the complexity of the tannins and the elegant integration of blackberry and black currant fruit with oak a dramatic impressive wine that shows you dont have to spend a lot of money for a terrific california cab now2012
7343,this 100 cabernet is so ripe with blackberries cherries and new french oak its delicious to drink now the tannins are strong however leading to a hard finish give it eight years to soften and smooth out
7344,this 100 cabernet made solidly in the modern style of soft ripeness and considerable alcohol is flamboyant in milk chocolate blackberry jam and smoky oak flavors for all the apparent sweetness it finishes thoroughly dry and classy drink over the next 23 years
7345,this 100 cabernet sauvignon has massive waves of blackberry black currant and chocolate flavors that take over the palate plus a sweet note of toast from the oak its very tannic which gives the mouthfeel an astringent hardness so try giving it 68 years in a cellar and it may even show well in 1215 years
7346,this 100 cabernet sauvignon is a more subtle and more interesting wine than the winerys cab franc here the ripeness seems more stable and balanced with just the right hints of leaf and bark and a subtle suggestion of chocolate the finish is smooth and textural and a bit of coffee kicks in right at the end very nice
7347,this 100 cabernet sauvignon is very strong in blackberries black currants and cedar its also quite tannic clearly a rich wellgrown wine but marked by immaturity with unintegrated sweet fruit and oak flavors needs a good six years to start to knit together
7348,this 100 cabernet sauvignon was aged in a 5050 mix of french and american oak it is still quite astringent tannic and herbal needing more bottle age to meld the somewhat harsh barrel flavors the tart fruit flavors combine rhubarb and raspberries black cherry and cassis
7349,this 100 carignan is a great expression of what the grape can do all by itself without any blending buddies red cherry and plum mingle with garrigue herbs and a touch of vanilla on the nose soft tannins and vibrant acidity lay out the approachable structure with a lingering finish accented by sweet spice
7350,this 100 chenin blanc is a beautiful exaple of what the variety can express soft florals loaded with garrigue notes alongside tropical fruit aromas of mango guava and pineapple its vibrant in the mouth with moderate acidity and a lifting backbone of lemon verbena the finish lingers gracefully and overall the wine is ripe and attractive without being sweet or cloying
7351,this 100 sangiovese shows aromas of stewed prune menthol star anise and a whiff of coconut the evolved palate shows raisin dried black cherry and sweet vanilla wood tannins leave a somewhat astringent close
7352,this 100 sauvignon blanc is a fresh delicious summer wine it is light and clean with flavors of mango and citrus and a flowery feel acidity gives it a great lift to the finish
7353,this 100 syrah from les aphillanthes is smoky and slightly herbal offering wonderfully complex hints to go along with bold blueberry flavors a bit chunky but fullbodied and winsome with fruit flavors that pump out through the long finish drink now2012
7354,this 100 syrah is thick and intense with strong black fruit flavors lifted by accents of anise and milk chocolate the mouth is full of ripe plum and cherry flavors with wellintegrated tannins and a solid juicy finish

9061,to judge by the blast of white pepper and strong tannins the northern rhône is the model for this dry singlevineyard wine it is a distinguished syrah but too tannic and closed down now for thorough enjoyment best to cellar for 3 or 4 years maybe longer until it throws some sediment

9110,too raw and acidic for me with jammy blackberry and cherry flavors this pinot unsuccessfully tries to make up in power what it lacks in finesse its a good wine but a disappointment given the lineage which stems directly from caymus

9119,too sweet and soft like a confection in a glass tastes like a raspberry and cherry tart spiced with cinnamon and dusted with cocoa and turns hot and portylike on the finish
9120,too sweet by far with a white sugary finish to the pineapple and pear flavors crisp acidity helps to provide a framework of balance but the sweetness really feeds into the perception that california white wines have residual sugar
9121,too sweet soft and simple in cherrycola flavors this syrah would benefit from more dryness and greater structure it turns porty on the finish drink now
9122,too sweet with a sugary finish that tastes like lemonade and pineapple juice
9123,too young for drinking now or anytime soon for that matter its all primary blackberry and currant fruit new oak and tannins but theres a dramatic quality to the structure a purity of parts that suggests the cellar there are waves of licorice mocha and buttered cinnamon toast with everything vying for supremacy let all the elements battle it out for a good six years this wine should age gracefully through 2015 at least
9124,too young now the wine is tannic and acidic with cherryberry flavors its not really very interesting instead its kind of raw and dry maybe it will go someplace

9136,tough and gnarly in its mouthfeel with semisweet flavors of raspberry and cherry jam its a decent everyday wine but overpriced

9140,tough going with this wine its very dry and shows the high acidity of the variety and even some rasping tannins unfortunately the fruit isnt there despite a modest attempt by the cherry squad to come to the rescue

9143,tough in tannins austerely dry and thin in fruit this cab lacks voluptuousness youll find cooked cherryberry flavors that are swamped by alcohol and tannins
9144,tough in tannins hard in acids and funky this cabernet is difficult to appreciate now despite obviously ripe blackberries and cassis it resists the palates attempts to break it down and finishes with a firm astringency maybe it will age out try after 2014
