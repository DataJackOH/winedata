This repo is an analysis of a fantastic kaggle wine review dataset found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews).

The jupyter notebook finds words that commonly occur together, and outputs CSV's based on particular attributes (price, variety, region).

Another .py file is used to generate 10k 'mock' reviews using the LSTM technique, 10k of which has been saved as a csv too.
