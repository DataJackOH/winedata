sweetness and heat that detractfrom an estate vineyard off olivet lane in the heart of the santa rosa plain this wine is comparatively intense and meaty compared to some of its counterparts from the cooler sebastopol hills earthy mushroom and a tart tangy note of orange give it a lift along with a light layering of freshcut rose before finishing in richer dark chocolatecreamy fresh white fruit and toast on the nose hint at a fullness that the wine does not quite deliver on the palate but overall the fruit is good this tends toward tart and needs the balance of more oak to cut the edgefaiveleys general firm style of red wine is a great advantage in this simple burgundy this wine has structure red berry acidity ripe tannins and a lively vivid flavor to finish there is plenty of ripe aciditythis fruity beaujolais features hints of bananas and red berries its soft rounded and very approachable ready to drinkbottled only a few months prior to this tasting the wine was still rather closed aromatically but wonderfully ripe and supple on the palate waves of superripe creamytextured red fruit and vanilla flavors finish long bolstered by firm tannins drink 201020189092 barrel sample the botrytis is amazingly perfumed smelling like a paris perfume shop the fruit is lost in a crazy range of exotic flavors fun but very differentan impressive effort with reticent black currant and cassis tones upfront followed by pomegranate in the mouth theres good depth of flavor here though the marked acidity and broad tannins require pairing with hearty fare better after 2010heres a super tuscan blend of sangiovese and cabernet sauvignon that shows its 10 years of age surprising well theres still loads of fruit here backed by tertiary aromas of licorice polished stone dried fruit and old leathershows all the hallmarks of the upscale cabs the winery is better known for from the softly sensuous mouthfeel ripe fruit and judicious use of new french oak to the longlasting complexities red and black cherry jam cassis plum sauce gingerbread smoky vanillins peppery spice and its all dry and balanced whats not to like drink nowexcept for a taste of cooked grapes this is a pretty good sangiovese its dry and crisp in acidity with a nice earthiness behind the cherries but you can taste the burnt berries that just got roasted under the hot sun of this vintagea little stinky and oily which is often the downfall of the variety the palate has a viscous grab to it and the flavors are rather generic and rudimentary ie simple apple and melon with a mild chemical burn seems only semifresh at a young ageambrosan takes amarone intensity to the next level the wine is plump rich and loaded with dark fruit spice and smoke possible food pairings include red meat or roast pork that would match the stamina but also the overall softness of the tanninsrose strawberry and forest floor aromas meld in the glass on this charming expression of nebbiolo the bright savory palate doles out crushed strawberry black raspberry clove and star anise alongside silky tannins like a little black dress this would be perfect for any occasiona blend of cabernet sauvignon merlot and syrah this shows savory spice smoked meat and tobacco notes followed by blackberry dark cherry and cola the palate is fresh and clean but it has enough heft to be paired with grilled meatthis somewhat broad mouthcoating wine should prove attractive to consumers weaned on california pinot noirs dark earthy mocha notes lead into a round palate with flavors of cherry preserves and chocolate probably best over the next 12 yearsdusty earth and dry spice aromas blend with some char vanilla and berrycherry on the nose the palate shows average density and depth with lighter flavors of strawberry raspberry herbs tobacco and vanilla finishes dry and peppery with some toastnot bad for an introductory or everyday sort of pinot of course its a bit thin and acidic but nicely silky with modest cherry cola and mint flavorspart of fattoria nittardis celebrated artist series a creative design is released on the label of each new vintage this plush chianti classico offers toasted nut mature fruit leather and dried tobacco the aromas are slightly muddled at first and come into focus with more time in the glassthis wine is full in the mouth with a taste between pepper and fruit its ripe rounded and tangy with clementine zest as well crisp apples and red currants it could benefit from a few months in bottle so drink from late 2015the aromas are earthy rich in moist soil the palate is just as rich a full opulent wine powered with yellow fruits and a light touch of spicedry and tantalizingly complex with racy acidity and elegance it shows meyer lemon lime pear and sweet gooseberry flavors with a touch of vanilla and toast from oak agingdespite 1512 percent alcohol this wine still has residual sugar think what the brix must have been at harvest drinks like a port which is a major fault for a dry table wine tasted twice with consistent resultsbone dry and delicately structured it has good acidity cutting across herb tea apricot orange rind and white pepper flavors the wine shows some true complexity and interestbranders stainless steel fermented sauvignon is an exciting wine simply brilliant in pure fruit and mouthwatering acidity its as fresh as a harvest morning with intense flavors of lemongrass gooseberry tangerine zest green grass and vanilla certainly at the top of its classdry and a bit sharp this rheinhessen trocken has some funky low notes under its peach and pear fruit its light on its feet and suitable for a raw bar drink uppure varietal and surprisingly light for this often tannic grape this leads with pretty raspberry and cherry fruit set in sweet baking spices and finished with a lick of chocolate and a frame of toasty oak its balanced and proportionate though definitely on the lighter sidegood price for a santa rita hills pinot noir this good shows lots of zippy acidity and is very dry with complex layers of raspberries cherries dr pepper cola and dusty spices drink nowflavorful but somewhat chunky and direct yabby lakes 2008 chardonnay features notes

fruitiness while the steely edge adds structure and gives the wine a fine tensionlean dry and minerally with tart flavors of grapefruit lemon peel and asian pear the acidity is refreshingly crisp this is a bottling that rarely does well in blind tastings because its so austere but it is elegantthis estate reserve has more grip and tannin than the other 2006 pinot from winters hill it has been in bottle for two years now so you are buying a well cellared wine with significant flavor development the fruit is first rate and the wine is structured with plenty of acid and light barrel flavors of nougat and mochapure and cerebral but with enough natural liveliness that you cant help but love it aromas of schist lavender and plum mix with oakdriven bacon and chocolate to create a welcoming whole sizable cherry and plum flavors are round but also precise and firm looming tannins suggest some cellaring may be warranted the blend is garnacha followed by syrah and cabernet sauvignon imported by vinum internationala fullon ripe generous wine all red plums and bright berry fruits the tannins are sweet generous supported by vivid acidity this is an exciting wine one that could do with two years agingwith touches of honeycomb and granny smith apple this delightfully lush blend of 51 chardonnay and 49 sémillon from livermore partially barrel fermented in oak is a creamy

represents 20 hectares of vines planted to nebbiolo dolcetto and barbera the arborina cru has clay soils and its wines are as a result slightly more concentrated and darker in color aromas here recall blackberry black licorice and cherry colathis is a powerful wine almost too powerful for its own good with forward citrus tropical fruit and vanillaoak flavorsif only more california primitivo could be made in this style soft lower in alcohol modestly showing its fruit there would be more converts among zin fanatics who would be wowed by the subtle black cherry and licorice flavors and dry finish minimally aged in oaktheres a minerality to this chard that makes it bracing although it also shows the opulence of fogartys other 04s a tang of gunmetal undergirds the tropical fruit and vanilla custard flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture almost begs for shrimp lobster crab the more richly prepared the betterthis opens with a fragrance of white flowers hints of vanilla and oak the

as well as the notes of lemon and lime on the finish this should pair with a range of midweek dinnersa red cherry flavor and a rich texture show the ripe side of this plump wine it has tannins and a touch of bitter chocolate its already full and generous but it does need to age for at least six yearsheres a thick dense ripasso with a dusty aristocratic quality that makes the wine taste older than it really is the wine is accented by notes of smoked bacon and beef jerky and shows very good depth and complexity overall its good value too imported by premium brandsinitially this smells damp and earthy although with airing a mix of leather berry fruits and vanilla emerge the palate is bumpy and borderline sticky feeling with baked earthy flavors of black fruits and herbal tones the finish is short and tastes a little raisinya powerful wine with forceful minerality still its loaded with expressive fruit that falls squarely into the pineapplemango category finishes crisp but precise with notes of wet stone and lingering nips of green apple and peachkind of brown which makes sense seeing that its an older 2008 model the nose shows sweet peach and mango aromas and some oxidization the palate is drying and short with bittertinged peach and citrus flavors flat and dry on the finishthis wine certainly doesnt taste its age it has more to do with sweet almond cookies and unbalanced spirit than mature flavors imported by langdon shiverickthis singlevineyard pinot noir shows fine coastal acidity and dryness and a transparency of taste that comes from the terroir its very delicious with jammy raspberry and cherry fruit flavors enriched with oaky vanillins and smoky buttery caramel gorgeous and compelling combining power and nuance its a wine to drink now and through 2015 at leastthis maipo malbec is a bit pinched and gritty up front with leather rubber and raspberry aromas in the backdrop a full chunky palate offers mildly herbal baked berry flavors in front of a spicy minty mildly hot finish this is nice for chilean malbec but a little aggressivethis tight chewy spicy syrah fills out as it breathes though not as big and ripe as the other tulpen reds this brings in subtle nuances of herb spice mint and white pepper bottom line more structure but less hedonistic fruitan intriguing wine this boasts herbal tobacco and trufflelaced aromatics backed by a modicum of cassis fruit and a wonderfully soft creamy supple texture the flavors also veer dangerously close to vegetal so if you insist on no green notes in your cab search somewhere elsesmells herbal and minty which is strange given the vintages heat and tastes earthy too with oregano and barely ripe cherry flavors turns dry and crisp on the finish consider this an elegant stylethis plump mediumbodied
